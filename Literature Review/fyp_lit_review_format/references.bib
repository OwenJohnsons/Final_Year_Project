abstract = {We derive general relationships between the observed timescale of diffractive interstellar scintillations and the physical velocities of the observer, the source, and the scattering medium. Our treatment applies exclusively to saturated scintillations of point sources in the strong scattering regime. We show how scintillation observations may be combined with other observables (proper motion and dispersion measure) to yield (1) improvements in galactic models for the free-electron density and (2) estimates of the distance and transverse velocity of individual pulsars. We explicitly consider cases of current astrophysical interest, including hypervelocity pulsars too far above the Galactic plane to allow distance estimates from dispersion measures alone. We also briefly consider scintillations of extragalactic sources, including gamma-ray burst sources at great distances from the Galaxy.},

abstract = {The Allen Telescope Array (ATA) at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory (HCRO) is a wide-field panchromatic radio telescope currently consisting of 42 offset-Gregorian antennas each with a 6 m aperture, with plans to expand the array to 350 antennas. Through unique back-end hardware, the ATA performs real-time wideband beamforming with independent subarray capabilities and customizable beam shaping. The beamformers enable science observations requiring the full gain of the array, time domain (nonintegrated) output, and interference excision or orthogonal beamsets. In this paper we report on the design of this beamformer, including architecture and experimental results. Furthermore, we address some practical considerations in large-N wideband beamformers implemented on field programmable gate array platforms, including device utilization, methods of calibration and control, and interchip synchronization.},

abstract = {We analyze potential effects of an extraterrestrial civilization's use of orbiting mirrors to illuminate the dark side of a synchronously rotating planet on planetary transit light curves. Previous efforts to detect civilizations based on side effects of planetary-scale engineering have focused on structures affecting the host star output (e.g. Dyson spheres). However, younger civilizations are likely to be less advanced in their engineering efforts, yet still capable of sending small spacecraft into orbit. Since M dwarfs are the most common type of star in the solar neighborhood, it seems plausible that many of the nearest habitable planets orbit dim, low-mass M stars, and will be in synchronous rotation. Logically, a civilization evolving on such a planet may be inspired to illuminate their planet's dark side by placing a single large mirror at the L2 Lagrangian point, or launching a fleet of small thin mirrors into planetary orbit. We briefly examine the requirements and engineering challenges of such a collection of orbiting mirrors, then explore their impact on transit light curves. We incorporate stellar limb darkening and model a simplistic mirror fleet's effects for transits of Earth-like (R = 0.5 to 2 R_Earth) planets which would be synchronously rotating for orbits within the habitable zone of their host star. Although such an installation is undetectable in Kepler data, JWST will provide the sensitivity necessary to detect a fleet of mirrors orbiting Earth-like habitable planets around nearby stars.

abstract = {We summarize radio and optical SETI programs based at the University of California, Berkeley. The SEVENDIP optical pulse search looks for ns time scale pulses at visible wavelengths. It utilizes an automated 30 inch telescope, three ultra fast photo multiplier tubes and a coincidence detector. The target list includes F, G, K and M stars, globular cluster and galaxies. The ongoing SERENDIP V.v sky survey searches for radio signals at the 300 meter Arecibo Observatory. The currently installed configuration supports 128 million channels over a 200 MHz bandwidth with ~1.6 Hz spectral resolution. Frequency stepping allows the spectrometer to cover the full 300MHz band of the Arecibo L-band receivers. The final configuration will allow data from all 14 receivers in the Arecibo L-band Focal Array to be monitored simultaneously with over 1.8 billion channels. SETI@home uses the desktop computers of volunteers to analyze over 160 TB of data at taken at Arecibo. Over 6 million volunteers have run SETI@home during its 10 year history. The SETI@home sky survey is 10 times more sensitive than SERENDIP V.v but it covers only a 2.5 MHz band, centered on 1420 MHz. SETI@home searches a much wider parameter space, including 14 octaves of signal bandwidth and 15 octaves of pulse period with Doppler drift corrections from -100 Hz/s to +100 Hz/s. SETI@home is being expanded to analyze data collected during observations of Kepler objects of interest in May 2011. The Astropulse project is the first SETI search for $\mu$s time scale pulses in the radio spectrum. Because short pulses are dispersed by the interstellar medium, and the amount of dispersion is unknown, Astropulse must search through 30,000 possible dispersions. Substantial computing power is required to conduct this search, so the project uses volunteers and their personal computers to carry out the computation (using distributed computing similar to SETI@home). Keywords: radio instrumentation, FPGA spectrometers, SETI, optical SETI, Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, volunteer computing, radio transients, optical transients.},

abstract = {RECONS (REsearch Consortium On Nearby Stars, www.recons.org) turns 20 in 2014, so we take this opportunity to review some of the highlights of the RECONS effort over the past two decades. Through comprehensive searches for new nearby stars, as well as characterization of the stars and exploration of their environments, the RECONS team has made significant contributions to our understanding of the solar neighborhood, and of our own place in the Universe. Here we highlight results detailed in more than 30 papers in The Solar Neighborhood series published in The Astronomical Journal, including: (1) a census indicating that at least 75% of all stars are red dwarfs, which have more real estate available for habitable planets than any other type of star, (2) more than 300 new stellar systems with accurate trigonometric parallaxes placing them within 25 pc, including 12 of the nearest 100 systems, (3) thousands of additional nearby star candidates identified through traditional proper motion searches and novel photometric searches for stars exhibiting minimal proper motions, (4) increases of more than 20% in the nearest white dwarf and cool subdwarf populations, (5) discovery of the nearest star, AP Col, younger than 100 million years, (6) knowledge that more than half of stellar systems contain only one star, dominated by the red dwarf multiplicity rate of only about 30%, (7) definition of the smallest main sequence star, with a radius only 9% that of the Sun (smaller than Jupiter) and a temperature of 2100K, and (8) a revelation that the smallest stars are rarely orbited by giant planets, including the elimination of planets down to half a Jupiter mass orbiting Proxima Centauri. As RECONS enters its third decade, we continue our reconnaissance of the solar neighborhood via a comprehensive survey to understand the nature of star formation by determining accurate luminosity and mass functions for the nearest stars. In addition, we are taking an inventory of nearby planets, including an astrometric search of several hundred of the nearest red dwarfs for planetary systems. This effort is supported by the NSF through grants AST-0908402 and AST-1109445, and via observations made possible by the SMARTS Consortium.},

abstract = {A passive and active strategy for the reception and transmission of call signals, from and to other possible extraterrestrial civilizations is suggested using the explosion of SN1987A. The reception area is an ellipsoid with the Earth and the supernova in its focuses, in the direction of SN1987A. Three hundred and forty objects have been identified inside this surface and four of them are stars with environments similar to our sun (e.g. necessary for the development of life and intelligence). A search strategy to look for 'fake' pulsars signals, originated in other possible technological civilizations, in this direction, is examined. The active strategy consists in the transmission of terrestrial signals towards the hyperboloid surface (with the same focuses) in the antipodal direction of the supernova explosion. Thirty-three objects have been identified inside the hyperboloid and three of them are solar-type nearby stars. The transmission characteristics of a terrestrial origin 'fake' pulsar (e.g. modulation, frequency, bandwidth, periods, duty cycle, etc.) are discussed in some detail. The possible use of available planetary radars to develop such a proposal and the criterion of artificiarity, without any implicit code or semantics is reviewed. A difference between active search and communication is established.},

We searched for Earth-size planets that cross in front of their host stars by examining the brightness measurements of 42,000 stars from National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Kepler mission. We found 603 planets, including 10 that are Earth size (1-2 Earth-radii) and receive comparable levels of stellar energy to that of Earth (within a factor of four). We account for Kepler's imperfect detectability of such planets by injecting synthetic planet-caused dimmings into the Kepler brightness measurements and recording the fraction detected. We find that 11$\pm$4% of Sun-like stars harbor an Earth-size planet receiving between one and four times the stellar intensity as Earth. We also find that the occurrence of Earth-size planets is constant with increasing orbital period (P), within equal intervals of logP up to ˜200 d. Extrapolating, one finds 5.7^{+1.7}_{-2.2}% of Sun-like stars harbor an Earth-size planet with orbital periods of 200-400 d.},

We find 3897 dwarfs with temperatures below 4000K, including 64 planet candidate host stars orbited by 95 transiting planet candidates. We refit the transit events in the Kepler light curves for these planet candidates and combine the revised planet/star radius ratios with our improved stellar radii to revise the radii of the planet candidates orbiting the cool target stars. We then compare the number of observed planet candidates to the number of stars around which such planets could have been detected in order to estimate the planet occurrence rate around cool stars. We find that the occurrence rate of 0.5-4 Earth radius planets with orbital periods shorter than 50 days is 0.90 (+0.04/-0.03) planets per star. The occurrence rate of Earth-size (0.5-1.4 Earth radius) planets is constant across the temperature range of our sample at 0.51 (+0.06/-0.05) Earth-size planets per star, but the occurrence of 1.4-4 Earth radius planets decreases significantly at cooler temperatures. Our sample includes 2 Earth-size planet candidates in the habitable zone, allowing us to estimate that the mean number of Earth-size planets in the habitable zone is 0.15 (+0.13/-0.06) planets per cool star. Our 95% confidence lower limit on the occurrence rate of Earth-size planets in the habitable zones of cool stars is 0.04 planets per star. With 95% confidence, the nearest transiting Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of a cool star is within 21 pc.

As such it seems surprising that one would ask whether their performance is dictated by quantum theory. However in this talk we show that it is, due to the very large losses in link budget. In this talk we discuss the quantum limits of radar performance for deep space tracking and other radars. A radar is said to be a quantum radar if at the detector level we have insufficient RF target photon density to invoke classical physics by means of the Gaussian central limit theorem. We discuss the performance modeling in this regime and in particular look at how quantum theory informs the dish verses array trade. View full abstract},

abstract = {A Search for Extraterrestrial Life (SETI), based on the possibility of interstellar communication via laser signals, is being designed to extend the search into the near-infrared spectral region (Wright et al, this conference). The dedicated near-infrared (900 to 1700 nm) instrument takes advantage of a new generation of avalanche photodiodes (APD), based on internal discrete amplification. These discrete APD (DAPD) detectors have a high speed response (< 1 GHz) and gain comparable to photomultiplier tubes, while also achieving significantly lower noise than previous APDs. We are investigating the use of DAPD detectors in this new astronomical instrument for a SETI search and transient source observations. We investigated experimentally the advantages of using a multiple detector device operating in parallel to remove spurious signals. We present the detector characterization and performance of the instrument in terms of false positive detection rates both theoretically and empirically through lab measurements. We discuss the required criteria that will be needed for laser light pulse detection in our experiment. These criteria are defined to optimize the trade between high detection efficiency and low false positive coincident signals, which can be produced by detector dark noise, background light, cosmic rays, and astronomical sources. We investigate experimentally how false coincidence rates depend on the number of detectors in parallel, and on the signal pulse height and width. We also look into the corresponding threshold to each of the signals to optimize the sensitivity while also reducing the false coincidence rates. Lastly, we discuss the analytical solution used to predict the probability of laser pulse detection with multiple detectors.},

abstract = {Past schemes for using beamed microwave power for space propulsion and providing power to space platforms have used microwaves below 10 GHz. Recent expansions of the high power microwave technology domain offer fundamental reassessment of the following missions: 1) location of orbital debris, 2) supplying power to loitering high-altitude airplanes, 3) satellite battery recharging, 4) imaging of asteroids, 5) orbit raising and transfer, 6) interplanetary probe launch to the outer planets and comets, and ultimately, 7) launch into Earth orbit. This group of applications may be done by a ground-based system. The system would start small, being built for the near Earth missions, and be enlarged incrementally as the technology matures and confidence develops. Of particular interest are sources in the millimeter range where there are low loss atmospheric windows and MJ pulses are available in quasi-CW operation. A development scenario for these missions using millimeter wave technolgy is described.},

abstract = {We report on radio and X-ray observations of the only known repeating Fast Radio Burst (FRB) source, FRB 121102. We have detected six additional radio bursts from this source: five with the Green Bank Telescope at 2 GHz, and one at 1.4 GHz at the Arecibo Observatory for a total of 17 bursts from this source. All have dispersion measures consistent with a single value ($\sim559$ pc cm$^{-3}$) that is three times the predicted maximum Galactic value. The 2-GHz bursts have highly variable spectra like those at 1.4 GHz, indicating that the frequency structure seen across the individual 1.4 and 2-GHz bandpasses is part of a wideband process. X-ray observations of the FRB 121102 field with the Swift and Chandra observatories show at least one possible counterpart; however, the probability of chance superposition is high. A radio imaging observation of the field with the Jansky Very Large Array at 1.6 GHz yields a 5$\sigma$ upper limit of 0.3 mJy on any point-source continuum emission. This upper limit, combined with archival WISE 22-$\mu$m and IPHAS H$\alpha$ surveys, rules out the presence of an intervening Galactic HII region. We update our estimate of the FRB detection rate in the PALFA survey to be 1.1$^{+3.7}_{-1.0} \times 10^4$ FRBs sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ (95% confidence) for peak flux density at 1.4 GHz above 300 mJy. We find that the intrinsic widths of the 12 FRB 121102 bursts from Arecibo are, on average, significantly longer than the intrinsic widths of the 13 single-component FRBs detected with the Parkes telescope.},

abstract = {We are designing and constructing a new SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) instrument to search for direct evidence of interstellar communications via pulsed laser signals at near-infrared wavelengths. The new instrument design builds upon our past optical SETI experiences, and is the first step toward a new, more versatile and sophisticated generation of very fast optical and near-infrared pulse search devices. We present our instrumental design by giving an overview of the opto-mechanical design, detector selection and characterization, signal processing, and integration procedure. This project makes use of near-infrared (950 - 1650 nm) discrete amplification Avalanche Photodiodes (APD) that have > 1 GHz bandwidths with low noise characteristics and moderate gain (~104). We have investigated the use of single versus multiple detectors in our instrument (see Maire et al., this conference), and have optimized the system to have both high sensitivity and low false coincidence rates. Our design is optimized for use behind a 1m telescope and includes an optical camera for acquisition and guiding. A goal is to make our instrument relatively economical and easy to duplicate. We describe our observational setup and our initial search strategies for SETI targets, and for potential interesting compact astrophysical objects.},

abstract = {Project Phoenix, descendant of the NASA targeted search, performs a systematic, high sensitivity, dual-polarization, search that covers 1 to 3 GHz and concentrates on nearby sun-like stars. It looks primarily for drifting CW signals at high resolution. Its most notable successes have been its high sensitivity, and very good immunity to interference, brought about through use of multiple site confirmations and an RFI database. Searches for sparsely spaced pulses are also conducted over a set of lengths, ranging in approximately octave steps from 1 to 1/32 second, but these do not systematically cover the frequency range of the CW effort. The Phoenix project's duration has been extended, distributing the planned observations over a longer period, because of the generally high demand for radio telescope time. If microwave SETI is to succeed as a long term enterprise, it must search many stars with high efficiency, evolving to take advantage of new computing and antenna resources. The next generation of SETI Institute targeted searches will use modular hardware, based on commercial systems rather than custom designs. Telescopes with multiple beams will be employed to allow faster searching of the sky in collaboration with other radio astronomy. Spectrometers with greater bandwidth will fully utilize new wide band feed designs. Interference rejection may be enhanced by direct suppression of strong undesired signals. Vast, cheap computing resources will allow efficient tradeoff of bandwidth, number of beams, and number of processing elements used to assemble increased collecting area. When computing resources become even more available, the complement to the targeted approach, a systematic, all-sky search for low duty cycle pulses or transient events, may be feasible.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of two highly dispersed pulsars in the direction of the Galactic Centre made during a survey at 3.1 GHz with the Parkes radio telescope. Both PSRs J1745-2912 and J1746-2856 have an angular separation from the Galactic Centre of less than 0.3 degrees and dispersion measures in excess of 1100 cm-3pc, placing them in the top 10 pulsars when ranked on this value. The frequency dependence of the scatter-broadening in PSR J1746-2856 is much shallower than expected from simple theory. We believe it likely that the pulsars are located between 150 and 500 pc from the Galactic Centre on the near side, and are part of an excess population of neutron stars associated with the Centre itself. A second survey made at 8.4 GHz did not detect any pulsars. This implies either that there are not many bright, long-period pulsars at the Galactic Centre or that the scattering is more severe at high frequencies than current models would suggest.

Two 86-GHz SiO masers were detected within the central parsec, and they are associated with IRS 10EE and IRS 15NE, respectively. We detected eighteen 43-GHz SiO masers within a projected separation of <2 pc from Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), among which seven masers are newly discovered from our observations. This raises the total number of 43-GHz SiO masers within the central 4 parsecs of the GC region to 22. Simultaneous observations at 86 and 43 GHz showed that the intensity of 43-GHz SiO maser is ~3 times higher than that of 86-GHz maser in IRS 10EE (an OH/IR star), while the integrated flux of the SiO maser emission at 43 GHz is comparable with that at 86~GHz in IRS~15NE (an ordinary Mira variable). These results are consistent with previous observations of massive late-type stars in the Galaxy in which the 86-GHz SiO maser is in general weaker than the 43-GHz SiO maser in OH/IR stars, while the two transitions are comparably strong in Mira stars.},

Some of the detections have been used in a previous paper to investigate the possibility of measuring milli-arcsecond accurate positions (to obtain stellar proper motions) in the Galactic center. Here we report on the detection of at least 25 H2O masers and 18 SiO masers associated with stars within 2 degr and 15 arcmin of Sgr A*, respectively. This survey has more than doubled the total number of proper motion candidates to at least about 50 stellar objects. The stellar SiO masers are best suited for proper motion studies, although the initial OH, H2O or SiO maser positions may not be well enough determined to use for a-priori VLBI positions.

Utilizing a novel phased-array design, LOFAR is optimized for the largely unexplored low frequency range: 10 - 240 MHz. The construction of LOFAR in the Netherlands is almost complete and 8 international stations have already been deployed as well. The wide field-of-view and multi-beam capabilities, in combination with sub-milliJansky sensitivity at arcsec (and sub-arcsec) resolution, are unprecedented at these frequencies.

abstract = {We report the most sensitive water maser survey towards Bok globules to date, using NASA's 70m antenna in Robledo de Chavela (Spain). We observed 207 positions within the CB catalog with a higher probability of harboring a young star, using as selection criteria the presence of radio continuum emission (from submillimeter to centimeter wavelengths), geometrical centers of molecular outflows, peaks in maps of high-density gas tracers (NH3 or CS), and IRAS point sources. We have obtained 7 maser detections, 6 of which (in CB 34, CB 54, CB 65, CB 101, CB 199, and CB 232) are reported for the first time here. Most of the water masers we detected are likely to be associated with young stellar objects (YSOs), except for CB 101 (probably an evolved object) and CB 65 (uncertain nature). The water maser in CB 199 shows a relatively high shift (~30 km/s) of its velocity centroid with respect to the cloud velocity, which is unusual for low-mass YSOs. We speculate that high-velocity masers in this kind of object could be related with episodes of energetic mass-loss in close binaries. Alternatively, the maser in CB 199 could be pumped by a protoplanetary or a young planetary nebula. CB 232 is the smallest Bok globule (~0.6 pc) known to be associated with water maser emission, although it would be superseded by the cases of CB 65 (~0.3 pc) and CB 199 (~0.5 pc) if their association with YSOs is confirmed. All our selection criteria have statistically compatible detection rates, except for IRAS sources, which tend to be a somewhat worse predictor for the presence of maser emission.

abstract = {We present a statistical analysis that demonstrates that the overwhelming majority of Kepler candidate multiple transiting systems (multis) indeed represent true, physically associated transiting planets. Binary stars provide the primary source of false positives among Kepler planet candidates, implying that false positives should be nearly randomly distributed among Kepler targets. In contrast, true transiting planets would appear clustered around a smaller number of Kepler targets if detectable planets tend to come in systems and/or if the orbital planes of planets encircling the same star are correlated. There are more than one hundred times as many Kepler planet candidates in multi-candidate systems as would be predicted from a random distribution of candidates, implying that the vast majority are true planets. Most of these multis are multiple-planet systems orbiting the Kepler target star, but there are likely cases where (1) the planetary system orbits a fainter star, and the planets are thus significantly larger than has been estimated, or (2) the planets orbit different stars within a binary/multiple star system. We use the low overall false-positive rate among Kepler multis, together with analysis of Kepler spacecraft and ground-based data, to validate the closely packed Kepler-33 planetary system, which orbits a star that has evolved somewhat off of the main sequence. Kepler-33 hosts five transiting planets, with periods ranging from 5.67 to 41 days.},

abstract = {The Kepler Mission began its 3.5-year photometric monitoring campaign in May 2009 on a select group of approximately 150,000 stars. The stars were chosen from the ~half million in the field of view that are brighter than 16th magnitude. The selection criteria are quantitative metrics designed to optimize the scientific yield of the mission with regards to the detection of Earth-size planets in the habitable zone. This yields more than 90,000 G-type stars on or close to the Main Sequence, >20,000 of which are brighter than 14th magnitude. At the temperature extremes, the sample includes approximately 3,000 M-type dwarfs and a small sample of O and B-type MS stars <200. Small numbers of giants are included in the sample which contains ~5,000 stars with surface gravities log(g) < 3.5. We present a brief summary of the selection process and the stellar populations it yields in terms of surface gravity, effective temperature, and apparent magnitude. In addition to the primary, statistically-derived target set, several ancillary target lists were manually generated to enhance the science of the mission, examples being: known eclipsing binaries, open cluster members, and high proper-motion stars.},

This view was supported by the fact that these `magnetar candidates' exhibited, without exception, a surface dipole magnetic field (as inferred from the spin-down rate) in excess of the electron critical field (~4.4E+13 G). The recent discovery of fully-qualified magnetars, SGR 0418+5729 and Swift J1822.3-1606, with dipole magnetic field well in the range of ordinary radio pulsars posed a challenge to the standard picture, showing that a very strong field is not necessary for the onset of magnetar activity (chiefly bursts and outbursts). Here we summarize the observational status of the low-magnetic-field magnetars and discuss their properties in the context of the mainstream magnetar model and its main alternatives.},

This photon counting integral field unit (IFU), being built at UCSB and Caltech with detectors fabricated at JPL, will use a unique, highly multiplexed low temperature detector technology known as Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs). These detectors, which operate at 100 mK, should provide photon counting with energy resolution of R = E/{\delta}E > 20 and time resolution of a microsecond, with a quantum efficiency of around 50%. We expect to field the instrument at the Palomar 200" telescope in the first quarter of 2011 with an array containing 1024 pixels in a 32x32 pixel form factor to yield a field of view of approximately 10x10 arcseconds. The bandwidth of the camera is limited by the rising sky count rate at longer wavelengths, but we anticipate a bandwidth of 0.35 to 1.35 {\mu}m will be achievable. A simple optical path and compact dewar utilizing a cryogen-free adiabatic demagnetization refridgerator (ADR) allows the camera to be deployed quickly at Naysmith or Coude foci at a variety of telescopes. A highly expandable software defined radio (SDR) readout that can scale up to much larger arrays has been developed. },

abstract = {In August, 1981, the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope was used for 4 h to search for narrowband pulsing radio beacons in the direction of the Galactic Center. By using both the spatial discrimination and temporal stability available to an interferometric measurement, weak intermittent signals can be detected even in the face of the strong, naturally caused radiation from this region. A radio beacon within our bandwidth, centered on the 21 cm neutral hydrogen line, would be recognizable if it had a repetition period between 40 sec and 1/2h. The rms sensitivity to point sources was ˜50 mJy/cycle, and the detection limit was 500 mJy/cycle. The limit degrades for pulse widths <0.02 s. No repetitive signals were found. For a swept, narrow-band radio beacon constrained to the Galactic Disk (beamwidth = 0.02 rad), our detection limit corresponds to a transmitter power of 10 11 MW at the Galactic Center.},

abstract = { Radio transients are sporadic signals and their detection requires that the backends of radio telescopes be equipped with the appropriate hardware and software to undertake this. Observational programs to detect transients can be dedicated or they can piggy-back on observations made by other programs. It is the single-dish single-transient (non-periodical) mode which is considered in this paper. Because neither the width of a transient nor the time of its arrival is known, a sequential analysis in the form of a cumulative sum (cusum) algorithm is proposed here. Computer simulations and real observation data processing are included to demonstrate the performance of the cusum. The use of the Hough transform is here proposed for the purpose of non-coherent de-dispersion. It is possible that the detected transients could be radio frequency interferences (RFI) and a procedure is proposed here which can distinguish between celestial signals and man-made RFI. This procedure is based on an analysis of the statistical properties of the signals. },

During the 20th century our picture of diffuse material in space has grown from a simple model of isolated clouds in thermal equilibrium with stellar radiation fields to one of a richly varied composite of materials with a wide range of physical properties and morphologies. The solar system interacts with this dynamical interstellar medium, which dominates the properties of the interplanetary environment. Optical, radio, and UV astronomy allow us to study the clouds which form the galactic environment of the Sun. The composition and distribution of interstellar clouds in the disk and halo tell us about the history of elemental formation in our galaxy, and the past and future environment of the solar system. },

We address not only the narrowing and re-broadening of the maser lines, but also the deviations of Gaussian symmetry as a result of the various hyperfine components of the 22 GHz maser line. Non-LTE models of the H2O maser transition, including hyperfine structure and cross-relaxation, are compared with high spectral resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of the H2O masers in the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of a sample of late-type stars. This yields estimates on the thermal width in the maser region as well as the emerging maser flux and thus the level of saturation. We also discuss the effect of a velocity gradient along the maser path on the line widths and shapes of the line profile and the effect of the geometry of the maser region. We find that the typical velocity shift along the maser path is of the order of 1.0 km/s. The effect of this shift on the shape of the maser spectrum is difficult to distinguish from the effect of the hyperfine components.},

At the time of this publication, 706 stars from this first data set have exoplanet candidates with sizes from as small as that of the Earth to larger than that of Jupiter. Here we give the identity and characteristics of 306 released stars with planetary candidates. Data for the remaining 400 stars with planetary candidates will be released in February 2011. Over half the candidates on the released list have radii less than half that of Jupiter. The released stars include five possible multi-planet systems.

abstract = {Kepler's primary mission is a search for earth-size exoplanets in the habitable zone of late-type stars using the transit method. To effectively accomplish this mission, Kepler orbits the Sun and stares nearly continuously at one field-of-view which was carefully selected to provide an appropriate density of target stars. The data transmission rates, operational cycles, and target management requirements implied by this mission design have been optimized and integrated into a comprehensive plan for science operations. The commissioning phase completed all critical tasks and accomplished all objectives within a week of the pre-launch plan. Since starting science, the nominal data collection timeline has been interrupted by two safemode events, several losses of fine point, and some small pointing adjustments. The most important anomalies are understood and mitigated, so Kepler's technical performance metrics have improved significantly over this period and the prognosis for mission success is excellent. The Kepler data archive is established and hosting data for the science team, guest observers, and public. The first data sets to become publicly available include the monthly full-frame images, dropped targets, and individual sources as they are published. Data are released through the archive on a quarterly basis; the Kepler Results Catalog will be released annually starting in 2011.},

Our applications involve detection of weak signals in a background of noise--pulsar radio astronomy and the search for narrow-band radio emissions from extraterrestrial civilizations. The agility factors include total bandwidth, spacing of filter channels, selection of filter response and choice of output data format (voltage or detected power). The input is a complex analog voltage centered on zero frequency which is passed to the board via coaxial ports on the front panel. The computational kernels on this board are Harris HSP 43168 Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter devices. We can also operate the board in a 16-channel output mode. The 2-4 bit format digital output is presented to a custom backplane. Along with our development we have written a suite of simulation software tasks both to determine the sensitivity loss and non-linear gain response that result from quantization and to optimize filter responses.

abstract = {The Berkeley SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) program, named SERENDIP, was begun in the late 1970's. It is aimed at detecting narrow band radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations. The SERENDIP I, II and III systems have operated autonomously in a piggyback search mode, conducting unobtrusive, long-term observations on the world's largest radio telescopes. The latest generation SERENDIP instrument, SERENDIP III, is a four million channel FFT-based spectrum analyzer operating at 0.6 Hz resolution with a 1.7 second integration time. SERENDIP III has been operating at the NAIC Arecibo Observatory since April, 1992. Several independent criteria suggest that this search is the most sensitive SETI search in operation. To date SERENDIP III has accumulated over 3600 hours of high quality telescope time, observing 75% of the sky visible by the Arecibo telescope. Over this period SERENDIP III has analyzed over 30 trillion spectral bins, and recorded information on 110 million strong narrow band signals in the 424--435 MHz band. A handful of these signals have survived our RFI rejection and signal detection algorithms, and have thus been added to our list of ETI candidate signals. A follow-up observation program will be conducted next year in an attempt to verify each of these candidate signals. This work has been supported by NASA grant NAGW-2722.},

abstract = {The ability of artificial neural networks to perform extremely efficient computation and induction has seen them adopted for many real-time pattern recognition applications. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how these capabilities could be applied to the real- time analysis of data collected during a SETI radio search. We present the results of an experiment in which a simple recurrent neural network was trained to identify a signal with a non-natural extraterrestrial signature in raw power spectra. The signature that we assumed for this experiment is that of a drifting continuous wave point source transiting an antenna beam, as would be expected in a SETI search similar to Project SERENDIP. The results of our simulation illustrate the neural network's ability to extract features corresponding to those of the assumed extraterrestrial signal, whilst simultaneously rejecting features produced by noise and radio frequency interference. The network is able to perform this task at lower signal-to-noise ratios than the threshold currently used in Project SERENDIP and hence such a neural network based system would facilitate the analysis of SERENDIP data that would otherwise be discarded. In light of discussions with the team at Southern SERENDIP, we envisage such a neural network based system being utilised as an additional tool for SETI researchers, rather than as a replacement for current methods.},

The ongoing SERENDIP V sky survey searches for radio signals at the 300 meter Arecibo Observatory. The currently installed configuration supports 128 million channels over a 200 MHz bandwidth with 1.6 Hz spectral resolution. Frequency stepping allows the spectrometer to cover the full 300 MHz band of the Arecibo L-band receivers. The final configuration will allow data from all 14 receivers in the Arecibo L-band Focal Array to be monitored simultaneously with over 1.8 billion simultaneous channels. SETI@home uses desktop computers volunteers to analyze over 100 TB of at taken at Arecibo. Over 5 million volunteers have run SETI@home during its 10 year history. The SETI@home sky survey is 10 times more sensitive than SERENDIP V but it covers only a 2.5 MHz band, centered on 1420 MHz. SETI@home searches a much wider parameter space, including 14 octaves of signal bandwidth and 15 octaves of pulse period with Doppler drift corrections from -100 Hz/s to +100 Hz/s. The ASTROPULSE project is the first SETI search for $\mu$s time scale pulses in the radio spectrum. Because short pulses are dispersed by the interstellar medium, and amount of dispersion is unknown, ASTROPULSE must search through 30,000 possible dispersions. Substantial computing power is required to conduct this search, so the project will use volunteers and their personal computers to carry out the computation (using distributed computing similar to SETI@home). The SEVENDIP optical pulse search looks for ns time scale pulses at visible wavelengths. It utilizes an automated 30 inch telescope, three ultra fast photo multiplier tubes and a coincidence detector. The target list includes F,G,K and M stars, globular cluster and galaxies.},

The S-IV works in the backkground to normal activities and astronomical observations. It's been storing a large quantity of data from a wide spectrum of frequencies between 1.4GHz to 22GHz. Recently we have developed post processing software for raw S-IV data (SALVE. Software Aimed at off Line Verification ETI). SALVE aims to reject interference (RIP - Reject Interference Processing), to detect ETI signals with Doppler effect (DSP - Doppler Signal Processing) and to produce a final list with the most interesting candidate signal detected (CLS Candidate List Signal). To generate the proper algorithms and to verify their efficiency, we have made an ``on site'' test. In order to obtain the highest RFI rejection we have optimized the SFI algorithms considering the behaviour of local interference. Aiming our antenna toward the Mars Global Surveyor we have tested the effectiveness of the DSP algorithm. After the creation of a list by CLS, a targeted search will be made.},

The brightness temperatures of the interferometric 36 GHz detections unambiguously indicate for the first time that the emission is maser emission. The 36 GHz methanol masers are not co-spatial with 1720 MHz OH masers, indicating that the two species trace different shocks. The 36 GHz and 44 GHz methanol masers, which both are collisionally pumped, do not necessarily co-exist and may trace different methanol gas. The methanol masers seem correlated with NH_3(3,3) density peaks. We favor an explanation in which the 36 GHz Class I methanol masers outline regions of cloud-cloud collisions, perhaps just before the onset of the formation of individual massive stars. The transition of the Very Large Array (VLA) to the EVLA is well under way, and these detections demonstrate the bright future of this completely renewed instrument.},

Additional observations of the remaining candidate have failed to confirm arriving pulse events. We now plan to proceed in a more economical manner by operating in an unattended drift scan mode. Between operational and equipment modifications, efficiency will more than double.},

Scientists and engineers are actively exploiting all of the flexibility designed into this innovative instrument for simultaneously conducting surveys of the astrophysical sky and conducting searches for distant technological civilizations. This paper summarizes the design elements of the ATA, the cost savings made possible by the use of COTS components, and the cost/performance trades that eventually enabled this first snapshot radio camera. The fundamental scientific program of this new telescope is varied and exciting; some of the first astronomical results will be discussed.},

abstract = {Serendip II is an automated system designed to perform a real time search for narrow band radio signals in the spectra of sources in a regularly scheduled, non-Seti, astronomical observing program. Because Serendip II is expected to run continuously without requiring dedicated observing time, it is hoped that a large portion of the sky will be surveyed at high sensitivity and low cost. Serendip II will compute the power spectrum using a 65,536 channel fast Fourier transform processor with a real time bandwidth of 128 KHz and 2 Hz per channel resolution. After searching for peaks in a 100 KHz portion of the radio telescope's IF band, Serendip II will move to the next 100 KHz portion using a programmable frequency synthesizer; when the whole IF band has been scanned, the process will start again. Unidentified peaks in the power spectra are candidates for further study and their celestial coordinates will be recorded along with the time and power, IF and RF frequency, and bandwidth of the peak.},

We have confirmed the methanol maser with the new Expanded VLA (EVLA), in operation since March 2010, but were unsuccessful in detecting a water maser at this location. A direct application for this methanol maser is the determination of the proper motion of M31, such as was obtained with water masers in M33 and IC10 previously.

abstract = {Two independent, largely overlapping 1612 MHz data sets were searched for OH/IR stars in the Galactic center. One set, taken with the Very Large Array in the period 1988 to 1991, consists of 17 epochs monitoring data of \cite[Van Langevelde et al. (1993)]{van93}. The other set was observed in 1994, using the Australia Telescope Compact Array. This article describes the data reduction procedures as well as a different way of searching image cubes for narrow line sources, and lists a total of 155 double peak OH maser detections within 18arcmin or 40 projected parsecs of Sagittarius A*, the compact radio continuum source in the Galactic nucleus. Presented are 65 formerly unseen double peaked 1612 MHz emitters, of which 52 are OH/IR stars. Also given are 3 single peak sources, which we believe to be masers of OH/IR stars. Apart from being less bright in their 1612 MHz OH maser line, the previously unknown OH/IR stars do not seem to be different from the previously known population of OH/IR stars in the Galactic center. We find that the OH/IR star OH maser luminosity distribution peaks at L_OH~ 10(43.4) photons per second. Further physical and kinematical analysis of the new sample will be presented in additional papers.

The controversial evidence at Venus is discussed, as well as the prospects for lightning-like discharges in Martian dust-storms (and studies on terrestrial analogues). In addition, lightning sources provide radio beacons that allow us to probe planetary ionospheres. Ground-based observations of Saturn's lightning have been attempted several times in the past and have been recently successful. They will be the subject of observations by the new generation of giant radio arrays. We review past results and future studies, focussing on the detection challenges and on the interest of ground-based radio monitoring, in conjunction with spacecraft observations or in standalone mode.},

abstract = {Saturn electrostatic discharges (SED) are freely-propagating radio emissions detected in the high frequency (HF) radio band (1-40 MHz) associated with electrical discharge (i.e., lightning) from storms in Saturn's atmosphere. While SEDs responsible for the RF emission are considered to be very energetic superbolts (>1013 J), this determination is intimately related to the temporal nature of the discharge itself. As we demonstrate, if we assume the discharge has similar temporal properties as terrestrial cloud-to-ground discharges (with a stroke time scale ~70 $\mu$s), then indeed the discharge energy has to be ~ 1013 J in order account for the Cassini-observed radiated HF power of ~50 W/Hz. However, if the discharge duration is faster than the terrestrial case (i.e., ~1 $\mu$s), the energy of the discharge can be weaker than the terrestrial case since the central peak of the emission shifts closer to the HF band. Because of the near-flat SED spectra measured in the HF which favors a faster discharge, we conclude that the high level of radiated HF power from SEDs may have less to do with any extreme super-bolt strength of the discharge and has more to do with the intrinsic quick time-scale of relatively weaker discharges.},

abstract = {Spectral kurtosis (SK) is a statistical approach for detecting and removing radio-frequency interference (RFI) in radio astronomy data. In this article, the statistical properties of the SK estimator are investigated and all moments of its probability density function are analytically determined. These moments provide a means to determine the tail probabilities of the estimator that are essential to defining the thresholds for RFI discrimination. It is shown that, for a number of accumulated spectra M≥24, the first SK standard moments satisfy the conditions required by a Pearson type IV probability density function (pdf), which is shown to accurately reproduce the observed distributions. The cumulative function (CF) of the Pearson type IV is then found, in both analytical and numerical forms, suitable for accurate estimation of the tail probabilities of the SK estimator. This same framework is also shown to be applicable to the related time-domain kurtosis (TDK) estimator, whose pdf corresponds to Pearson type IV when the number of time-domain samples is M≥46. The pdf and CF also are determined for this case.},

abstract = {We present a new model for the Galactic distribution of free electrons. It (a) describes the distribution of the free electrons responsible for pulsar dispersion measures and thus can be used for estimating the distances to pulsars; (b) describes large-scale variations in the strength of fluctuations in electron density that underly interstellar scattering; (c) can be used to interpret interstellar scattering and scintillation observations of Galactic objects and of extragalactic objects, such as intrinsically compact AGNs and Gamma-ray burst afterglows; and (d) serves as a preliminary, smooth spatial model of the warm ionized component of the interstellar gas. This work builds upon and supercedes the Taylor {\&} Cordes (1993) model by exploiting new observations and analysis methods. For lines of sight directed out of the Galactic plane, the new model yields substantially larger values for pulsar dispersion measures, except for directions dominated by the local hot bubble. Unlike the TC93 model, the new model provides sufficient electrons to account for the dispersion measures of the vast majority of known, Galactic pulsars. The new model is described and exemplified using plots of astronomically useful quantities on Galactic-coordinate grids. Software available on the Internet is also described. Future observations and analysis techniques that will improve the Galactic model are outlined.},

abstract = {Ketenimine (CH2CNH) has been detected in absorption toward the star-forming region Sagittarius B2(N) with the 100 m Green Bank Telescope by means of three rotational transitions: 716-808 at 41.5 GHz, 819-909 at 23.2 GHz, and 918-100,10 at 4.9 GHz. Ketenimine has a sparse rotational spectrum below 50 GHz. From transition line strength arguments, the spectral lines found are the ones most likely to be detected, and they occur in spectral regions that have little possibility of confusion with other molecular species. Partially resolved hyperfine structure is apparent in the 4.9 GHz transition, which has energy levels ~50 K above the ground-state level; the absorption seen in this transition appears to be emanating from gas in close proximity to the LMH hot core that has a systemic LSR velocity of +64 km s-1. By comparison, the 41.5 and 23.2 GHz transitions have lower energy levels of ~33 and ~41 K, respectively, and show absorption against the two star-forming Sgr B2(N) hot cores with systematic LSR velocities of +64 (the LMH) and +82 km s-1. These ketenimine data show that the hot core at +82 km s-1 is cooler than the hot core at +64 km s-1. Ketenimine is likely formed directly from its isomer methyl cyanide (CH3CN) by tautomerization driven by shocks that pervade the star-forming region.},

Results from just 43 days of data along with ground-based follow-up observations have identified five new transiting planets with measurements of their masses, radii, and orbital periods. Many aspects of stellar astrophysics also benefit from the unique, precise, extended, and nearly continuous data set for a large number and variety of stars. Early results for classical variables and eclipsing stars show great promise. To fully understand the methodology, processes, and eventually the results from the mission, we present the underlying rationale that ultimately led to the flight and ground system designs used to achieve the exquisite photometric performance. As an example of the initial photometric results, we present variability measurements that can be used to distinguish dwarf stars from red giants.},

An analysis of these four high signal-to-noise ratio rotational transitions yields a glycolaldehyde state temperature of ~8 K. Previously reported emission-line detections of glycolaldehyde with the NRAO 12 m telescope at millimeter wavelengths (71-103 GHz) are characterized by a state temperature of ~50 K. By comparison, the GBT detections are surprisingly strong and are seen in emission at 13.48 GHz, emission and absorption at 15.18 GHz, and absorption at 17.98 and 22.14 GHz. We attribute the strong absorption observed by the GBT at the higher frequencies to the correspondingly smaller GBT beams coupling better to the continuum source(s) in Sagittarius B2(N). A possible model for the two-temperature regions of glycolaldehyde is discussed.},

Because such microorganisms are minute, are preserved incompletely in geological materials, and have simple morphologies that can be mimicked by nonbiological mineral microstructures, discriminating between true microbial fossils and microscopic pseudofossil `lookalikes' can be difficult. Thus, valid identification of fossil microbes, which is essential to understanding the prokaryote-dominated, Precambrian 85% of life's history, can require more than traditional palaeontology that is focused on morphology. By combining optically discernible morphology with analyses of chemical composition, laser-Raman spectroscopic imagery of individual microscopic fossils provides a means by which to address this need. Here we apply this technique to exceptionally ancient fossil microbe-like objects, including the oldest such specimens reported from the geological record, and show that the results obtained substantiate the biological origin of the earliest cellular fossils known.},

abstract = {We use scattering theory, simulations, and empirical constraints on interstellar scintillations to discuss the intermittency of radio signals from extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI). The number of ETI sources in the Galaxy has a direct influence on the expected dynamic range of fluxes in a survey, through inverse square-law effects and, equally importantly, by the number of independent statistical trials made on modulations caused by interstellar scintillations. We demonstrate that scintillations are very likely to allow initial detections of narrowband signals, while making re-detections extremely improbable, a result that follows from the skewed, exponential distribution of the modulation. This conclusion holds for relatively distant sources but does not apply to radio SETI toward nearby stars (<~100 pc). Recent SETI has found nonrepeating, narrowband events that are largely unexplained. We consider three models in order to assess these events and to analyze large surveys in general: (model I) radiometer noise fluctuations; (model II) a population of constant Galactic sources that undergo deep fading and amplification due to interstellar scintillation, consistent with ETI transmissions; and (model III) real, transient signals (or hardware errors) of either terrestrial or extraterrestrial origin. We derive likelihood and Bayesian tests of the models for individual events and globally on entire surveys. Applying them to The Planetary Society/Harvard META data, we find that models II and III are both highly preferred to model I, but that models II and III are about equally likely. In the context of model II, the likelihood analysis indicates that candidate events above threshold (~32 sigma ) are combinations of large amplitude noise fluctuations and scintillation gains, making it highly probable that events seen once will only very rarely be seen again. Ruling out model II in favor of model III is difficult---to do so, many more reobservations (e.g., thousands) are needed than were conducted in META (hundreds) or the reobservation threshold must be much lower than was used in META. We cannot, therefore, rule out the possibility that META events are real, intrinsically steady ETI signals. Our formalism can be used to analyze any SETI program. We estimate the number of reobservations required to rule out model II in favor of model III, taking into account that reobservations made promptly sample the same scintillation gain as in the original detection, while delayed reobservations sample a decorrelated scintillation modulation. The required number is a strong function of the thresholds used in the original survey and in reobservations. We assess optimal methods for applying statistical tests in future SETI programs that use multiple site and multiple beam observations as well as single site observations. We recommend that results be recorded on many more events than have been made to date. In particular, we suggest that surveys use thresholds that are far below the false-alarm threshold that is usually set to yield a small number of noise-induced "detections" in a massive survey. Instead, large numbers of events should be recorded in order to (1) demonstrate that background noise conforms to the distribution expected for it; and (2) investigate departures from the expected noise distribution as due to interference or to celestial signals. In this way, celestial signals can be investigated at levels much smaller than the false-alarm threshold. The threshold level for archiving candidate intensities and their corresponding sky positions is best defined in terms of the recording and computational technology that is available at a cost commensurate with other survey costs.},

For each EIRP, we calculate the product of terms measuring the number of stars within detection range, the range of frequencies searched, and the number of independent observations for each star. For a given set of SETI observations, the result is a graph of merit vs transmitter EIRP. We apply this technique to several completed and ongoing SETI programs. The results provide a quantitative confirmation of the expected qualitative difference between sky surveys and targeted searches: the Project Phoenix targeted search is good for finding transmitters in the 10 exp 9 to 10 exp 14 W range, while the sky surveys do their best at higher powers. Current generation optical SETI is not yet competitive with microwave SETI.},

A better method, based on this argument, of searching for black-hole explosions by trying to detect linearly polarized radio-frequency pulses, rather than gamma-ray pulses, is proposed. To show the potential advantage, the gamma rays from a fireball with Lorentz factor = 100,000, situated within a distance of 1/100 pc, would only be registered by a detector of effective area 100 sq cm whereas even a crude nondirectional antenna would detect the corresponding radio pulse at distances of approximately 10,000 pc. An Arecibo-type telescope could detect such pulses, each triggered by a single entity of subnuclear size, from as far away as the Andromeda galaxy.},

A new autonomous infrastructure must close the loop from the scheduling of survey observations, through data archiving and pipeline processing, to the publication of transient event alerts and automated follow-up, and to the easy analysis of resulting data. The IVOA VOEvent {http://voevent.org} working group leads efforts to characterize sky transient alerts published through VOEventNet {http://voeventnet.org}. The Heterogeneous Telescope Networks (HTN {http://www.telescope-networks.org}) consortium are observatories and robotic telescope projects seeking interoperability with a long-term goal of creating an e-market for telescope time.

abstract = {Neutron stars are composed of the densest form of matter known to exist in our universe, and thus provide a unique laboratory for exploring the properties of cold matter at super-nuclear density. Measurements of the masses or radii of these objects can strongly constrain the neutron-star matter equation of state, and consequently the interior composition of neutron stars. Neutron stars that are visible as millisecond radio pulsars are especially useful in this respect, as timing observations of the radio pulses provide an extremely precise probe of both the pulsar's motion and the surrounding space-time metric. In particular, for a pulsar in a binary system, detection of the general relativistic Shapiro delay allows us to infer the masses of both the neutron star and its binary companion to high precision. Here we present radio timing observations of the binary millisecond pulsar PSR J1614-2230, which show a strong Shapiro delay signature. The implied pulsar mass of 1.97 +/- 0.04 M_sun is by far the highest yet measured with such certainty, and effectively rules out the presence of hyperons, bosons, or free quarks at densities comparable to the nuclear saturation density.},

abstract = {The cores of most galaxies are thought to harbour supermassive black holes, which power galactic nuclei by converting the gravitational energy of accreting matter into radiation. Sagittarius A* (SgrA*), the compact source of radio, infrared and X-ray emission at the centre of the Milky Way, is the closest example of this phenomenon, with an estimated black hole mass that is 4,000,000 times that of the Sun. A long-standing astronomical goal is to resolve structures in the innermost accretion flow surrounding SgrA*, where strong gravitational fields will distort the appearance of radiation emitted near the black hole. Radio observations at wavelengths of 3.5mm and 7mm have detected intrinsic structure in SgrA*, but the spatial resolution of observations at these wavelengths is limited by interstellar scattering. Here we report observations at a wavelength of 1.3mm that set a size of microarcseconds on the intrinsic diameter of SgrA*. This is less than the expected apparent size of the event horizon of the presumed black hole, suggesting that the bulk of SgrA* emission may not be centred on the black hole, but arises in the surrounding accretion flow.},

abstract = {We present radio transient search algorithms, results, and statistics from the ongoing Arecibo Pulsar ALFA (PALFA) survey of the Galactic plane. We have discovered seven objects through a search for isolated dispersed pulses. All of these objects are Galactic and have measured periods between 0.4 and 4.7 s. One of the new discoveries has a duty cycle of 0.01%, smaller than that of any other radio pulsar. We discuss the impact of selection effects on the detectability and classification of intermittent sources, and compare the efficiencies of periodicity and single-pulse (SP) searches for various pulsar classes. For some cases we find that the apparent intermittency is likely to be caused by off-axis detection or a short time window that selects only a few bright pulses and favors detection with our SP algorithm. In other cases, the intermittency appears to be intrinsic to the source. No transients were found with DMs large enough to require that they originate from sources outside our Galaxy. Accounting for the on-axis gain of the ALFA system, as well as the low gain but large solid-angle coverage of far-out sidelobes, we use the results of the survey so far to place limits on the amplitudes and event rates of transients of arbitrary origin.},

In a survey with the Arecibo telescope, we have found PSR J1903+0327, a radio pulsar with a rotational period of 2.15 ms in a highly eccentric (e = 0.44) 95-day orbit around a solar mass companion. Infrared observations identify a possible main-sequence companion star. Conventional binary stellar evolution models predict neither large orbital eccentricities nor main-sequence companions around millisecond pulsars. Alternative formation scenarios involve recycling a neutron star in a globular cluster then ejecting it into the Galactic disk or membership in a hierarchical triple system. A relativistic analysis of timing observations of the pulsar finds its mass to be 1.74+/-0.04 Msun, an unusually high value.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of PSR J1906+0746, a young 144-ms pulsar in a highly relativistic 3.98-hr orbit with an eccentricity of 0.085 and expected gravitational wave coalescence time of 300 Myr. The new pulsar was found during precursor survey observations with the Arecibo 1.4-GHz feed array system and retrospectively detected in the Parkes Multibeam plane pulsar survey data. From radio follow-up observations with Arecibo, Jodrell Bank, Green Bank, and Parkes, we have measured the spin-down and binary parameters of the pulsar and its basic spectral and polarization properties. We also present evidence for pulse profile evolution, which is likely due to geodetic precession, a relativistic effect caused by the misalignment of the pulsar spin and total angular momentum vectors. Our measurements show that PSR J1906+0746 is a young object with a characteristic age of 112 kyr. From the measured rate of orbital periastron advance 7.57+/-0.03 deg/yr, we infer a total system mass of 2.61+/-0.02 Msun. While these parameters suggest that the PSR J1906+0746 binary system might be a younger version of the double pulsar system, intensive searches for radio pulses from the companion have so far been unsuccessful. It is therefore not known whether the companion is another neutron star or a massive white dwarf. Regardless of the nature of the companion, a simple calculation suggests that the Galactic birth rate of binaries similar to PSR J1906+0746 is 60/Myr. This implies that PSR J1906+0746 will make a significant contribution to the computed cosmic inspiral rate of compact binary systems.

It has now found a 40.8 Hz isolated pulsar in radio survey data from the Arecibo Observatory taken in February 2007. Additional timing observations indicate that this pulsar is likely a disrupted recycled pulsar. PSR J2007+2722's pulse profile is remarkably wide with emission over almost the entire spin period; the pulsar likely has closely aligned magnetic and spin axes. The massive computing power provided by volunteers should enable many more such discoveries.

The large number of observations made over a period of more than 3 yr have reduced many of the effects of refractive and diffractive interstellar scintillation and have provided greatly improved flux density measurements for 280 pulsars. Our results show that, over the frequency range considered, the spectral behaviour of the majority of pulsars can be well described by a simple power law. Using this data base, together with other published data, we have studied the spectra of a large fraction of the known pulsar population. The mean spectral index in our sample is - 1.6, similar to that previously thought. There is a broad inverse correlation between spectral index and characteristic age. Millisecond pulsars exhibit a strong, positive correlation between spectral index and period. As a by-product of this study, we have determined pulse widths at 408 MHz for the majority of the pulsars in our sample, many of which were not previously published. The correlation between pulse duty cycle and pulse period, as noted by previous authors, is clearly seen in our data.},

The average interval between observations was about 9d and the observation duration ranged between 2 and 6h depending on the pulsar. Wide variations in the DISS parameters were observed over the 18-month data span. Despite this, the average scintillation velocities are in excellent agreement with the proper motion velocities. The average two-dimensional autocorrelation function for PSR B0329+54 is well described by a thin-screen Kolmogorov model, at least along the time and frequency axes. Observed modulation indices for the DISS time-scale and bandwidth and the pulsar flux density are greater than values predicted for a Kolmogorov spectrum of electron density fluctuations. Correlated variations over times that are long compared to the nominal refractive scintillation time are observed, suggesting that larger scale density fluctuations are important. For these pulsars, the scintillation bandwidth as a function of frequency has a power-law index (~3.6) much less than that expected for Kolmogorov turbulence (~4.4). Sloping fringes are commonly observed in the dynamic spectra, especially for PSR B0329+54. The detected range of fringe slopes are limited by our observing resolution. Our observations are sensitive to larger-scale fringes and hence smaller refractive angles, corresponding to the central part of the scattering disc.},

We have made 2-h observations of 23 pulsars which showed evidence for pulse nulling or mode changing in the survey data. Because of the low flux density of these pulsars, in most cases averaging times of between 10 and 60 s were necessary and so this analysis is insensitive to very short nulls. Seven of the pulsars had null fractions of more than 40 per cent with the largest having a lower limit of 95 per cent. Mode changes were observed in six pulsars with clear relationships between nulling and mode changing in some cases. Combined with earlier results, the data suggest that large null fractions are more related to large characteristic age than to long pulse period. The observations suggest that nulling and mode changing are different manifestations of the same phenomenon.},

abstract = {We present results from dynamical Monte Carlo simulations of dense star clusters near the Galactic center. These clusters sink toward the center of the Galaxy by dynamical friction. During their inspiral, they may undergo core collapse and form an intermediate-mass black hole through runaway collisions. Such a cluster can then reach within a parsec of the Galactic center before it completely disrupts, releasing many young stars in this region. This scenario provides a natural explanation for the presence of the young stars observed near the Galactic center. Here we determine the initial conditions for this scenario to work and we derive the mass distribution of cluster stars as a function of distance from the Galactic center. For reasonable initial conditions, we find that clusters massive enough for rapid inspiral would include more massive stars (m >~ 30 Msun) than currently observed in the inspiral region. We point out several possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy.

abstract = {We present VLBA observations of the ground-state hydroxyl masers in W3(OH) at 0.02 km s-1 spectral resolution. Over 250 masers are detected, including 56 Zeeman pairs. Line shapes are predominantly Gaussian or combinations of several Gaussians, with normalized deviations typically of the same magnitude as in masers in other species. Typical FWHM maser line widths are 0.15-0.38 km s-1 and are larger in the 1665 MHz transition than in the other three ground-state transitions. The satellite-line 1612 and 1720 MHz masers show no evidence of $\sigma$+/-2,3 components. The spatial positions of most masers are seen to vary across the line profile, with many spots showing clear, organized positional gradients. Equivalent line-of-sight velocity gradients in the plane of the sky typically range from 0.01 to 1 km s-1 AU-1 (i.e., positional gradients of 1-100 AU [km s-1]-1). Small velocity gradients in the 1667 MHz transition support theoretical predictions that 1667 MHz masers appear in regions with small velocity shifts along the amplification length. Deconvolved maser spot sizes appear to be larger in the line wings but do not support a spherical maser geometry.},

The goal of these coordinated multi-wavelength observations is to investigate the variable emission from Sgr A* in order to obtain a better understanding of the underlying physical processes in the accretion flow/outflow. The observations have been carried out using the NACO adaptive optics (AO) instrument at the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (July 2005, May 2007) and the ACIS-I instrument aboard the Chandra X-ray Observatory (July 2005). We report on a polarized NIR flare synchronous to a 8x1033 erg/s X-ray flare in July 2005, and a further flare in May 2007 that shows the highest sub-flare to flare contrast observed until now. The observations can be interpreted in the framework of a model involving a temporary disk with a short jet. In the disk component flux density variations can be explained due to hot spots on relativistic orbits around the central SMBH. The variations of the sub-structures of the May 2007 flare are interpreted as a variation of the hot spot structure due to differential rotation within the disk.},

abstract = { Using archival VLBI data for 3114 radio-luminous active galactic nuclei, we searched for binary supermassive black holes using a radio spectral index mapping technique which targets spatially resolved, double radio-emitting nuclei. Only one source was detected as a double nucleus. This result is compared with a cosmological merger rate model and interpreted in terms of (1) implications for post-merger timescales for centralisation of the two black holes, (2) implications for the possibility of "stalled" systems, and (3) the relationship of radio activity in nuclei to mergers. Our analysis suggests that the binary evolution of paired supermassive black holes (both of masses >= 1e8 Msun) spends less than 500 Myr in progression from the merging of galactic stellar cores to within the purported stalling radius for supermassive black hole pairs. The data show no evidence for an excess of stalled binary systems at small separations. We see circumstantial evidence that the relative state of radio emission between paired supermassive black holes is correlated within orbital separations of 2.5 kpc. },

Accompanying the data are brief reviews of the literature for each source, The results presented here aid in the statistical completeness of the Australia Telescope 20GHz Survey's bright source sample. The data are of crucial interest for future cosmic microwave background missions as a collection of information about candidate calibrator sources. We are able to obtain data for seven of the nine sources identified by our selection criteria. We report that Pictor A is thus far the best extragalactic calibrator candidate for the Low Frequency Instrument of the Planck European Space Agency mission due to its high level of integrated polarized flux density (0.50+/-0.06 Jy) on a scale of 10 arcmin. Six of the seven sources have a clearly detected compact radio core, with either a null or less than two percent detection of polarized emission from the nucleus. Most sources with detected jets have magnetic field alignments running in a longitudinal configuration, however PKS1333-33 exhibits transverse fields and an orthogonal change in field geometry from nucleus to jets. },

abstract = {Three years ago, the report of a solitary radio burst was thought to be the first discovery of a rare, impulsive event of unknown extragalactic origin (Lorimer et al. 2007). The extragalactic interpretation was based on the swept-frequency nature of the event, which followed the dispersive delay expected from an extragalactic pulse. We report here on the detection of 16 pulses, the bulk of which exhibit a frequency sweep with a shape and magnitude resembling the Lorimer Burst. These new events were detected in a sidelobe of the Parkes Telescope and are of clearly terrestrial origin, with properties unlike any known sources of terrestrial broad-band radio emission. The new detections cast doubt on the extragalactic interpretation of the original burst, and call for further sophistication in radio-pulse survey techniques to identify the origin of the anomalous terrestrial signals and definitively distinguish future extragalactic pulse detections from local signals. The ambiguous origin of these seemingly dispersed, swept-frequency signals suggest that radio-pulse searches using multiple detectors will be the only experiments able to provide definitive information about the origin of new swept-frequency radio burst detections.},

The system was sensitive to slow and most millisecond pulsars in the region with flux densities greater than approximately 0:3--1:1 mJy. Offline analysis on the 64-node Swinburne workstation cluster resulted in the detection of 170 pulsars of which 69 were new discoveries. Eight of the new pulsars, by virtue of their small spin periods and period derivatives, may be recycled and have been reported elsewhere. The slow pulsars discovered are typical of those already known in the volume searched, being of intermediate to old age. Several pulsars experience pulse nulling and two display very regular drifting subpulses. We discuss the new discoveries and provide timing parameters for the 48 slow pulsars for which we have a phase-connected solution.},

For multichannel observations the antenna-based bandpass solutions are also measured. Several antennas have a large pointing squint. After omitting antennas with pointing squint the measured beamwidths are ∼ 5% smaller than the current Gaussian model Since these observations are similar to mosaic projects we should get better mosaic imaging performance using the measured primary beam FWHM. The mean values for both axes are 149.7 +/- 4.0, 59.8 +/- 2.2, and 31.8 +/- 1.6 arcmin at 1430, 3500 and 6500 MHz respectively.},

References are given for all data listed. We have also developed a new World Wide Web interface for accessing and displaying either tabular or plotted data with the option of selecting pulsars to be displayed via logical con- ditions on parameter expressions. The Web interface has an ``expert'' mode giving access to a wider range of pa- rameters and allowing the use of custom databases. For users with locally installed software and database on Unix or Linux systems, the catalog may be accessed from a command-line interface. C-language functions to access specified parameters are also available. The catalog is updated from time to time to include new information.},

abstract = {Binaries consisting of a pulsar and a black hole (BH) are a holy grail of astrophysics, both for their significance for stellar evolution and for their potential application as probes of strong gravity. In spite of extensive surveys of our Galaxy and its system of globular clusters, no pulsar-black hole (PSR-BH) binary has been found to date. Clues as to where such systems might exist are therefore highly desirable. We show that if the central parsec around Sgr A⋆ harbors a cluster of ∼ 25,000 stellar BHs (as predicted by mass segregation arguments) and if it is also rich in recycled pulsar binaries (by analogy with globular clusters), then 3-body exchange interactions should produce PSR-BHs in the Galactic center. Simple estimates of the formation rate and survival time of these binaries suggest that a few PSR-BHs should be present in the central parsec today. The proposed formation mechanism makes unique predictions for the PSR-BH properties: 1) the binary would reside within ∼ 1 pc of Sgr A⋆; 2) the pulsar would be recycled, with a period of ∼ 1 to a few tens of milliseconds, and a low magnetic field B �� 1010 G; 3) the binary would have high eccentricity, e′ ∼ 0.8 but with a broad distribution; and 4) the binary would be relatively wide, with semi-major axis a′b ∼ 0.1− �� 3 AU. The potential discovery of a PSR-BH binary therefore provides a strong motivation for deep, high-frequency radio searches for recycled pulsars toward the Galactic center.},

The survey is designed to detect rare, bright transients as well as to commission the ATA's wide-field survey capabilities. ATATS explores the challenges of multi-epoch transient and variable source surveys in the domain of dynamic range limits and changing (u, v) coverage. Here, we present images made using data from the individual epochs, as well as a revised image combining data from all ATATS epochs. The combined image has rms noise $\sigma$ = 3.96 mJy beam-1, with a circular beam of 150'' FWHM. The catalog, generated using a false detection rate algorithm, contains 4984 sources and is >90% complete to 37.9 mJy. The catalogs generated from snapshot images of the individual epochs contain between 1170 and 2019 sources over the 564 deg2 area in common to all epochs. The 90% completeness limits of the single-epoch catalogs range from 98.6 to 232 mJy. We compare the catalog generated from the combined image to those from individual epochs, and from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey, a legacy survey at the same frequency. We are able to place new constraints on the transient population: fewer than 6 × 10-4 transients deg-2, for transients brighter than 350 mJy with characteristic timescales of minutes to days. This strongly rules out an astronomical origin for the ~1 Jy sources reported by Matsumura et al. based on their stated rate of 3.1 × 10-3 deg-2.},

This search discovered 34 new pulsars and detected 49 previously known ones. As has been the case with all previous surveys, no pulsars with intrinsic luminosities less than 0.3 mJy/sq kpc have been found. Because of the high sensitivity of the survey and its coverage of nearly 2 sr of sky, the present results imply that such low-luminosity pulsars do not constitute a large portion of the total active pulsar population in the Galaxy. Also in common with previous surveys, the sensitivity of this one deteriorates rather quickly for pulse periods less than a few tenths of a second. The extent to which this loss of sensitivity has biased the period distribution of known pulsars is discussed.},

The survey is designed to detect rare, very bright transients as well as to verify the capabilities of the ATA to form large mosaics. The combined image using data from all 12 ATATS epochs has rms noise $\sigma$ = 3.94 mJy beam-1 and dynamic range 180, with a circular beam of 150'' FWHM. It contains 4408 sources to a limiting sensitivity of 5$\sigma$ = 20 mJy beam-1. We compare the catalog generated from this 12 epoch combined image to the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), a legacy survey at the same frequency, and find that we can measure source positions to better than ~20''. For sources above the ATATS completeness limit, the median flux density is 97% of the median value for matched NVSS sources, indicative of an accurate overall flux calibration. We examine the effects of source confusion due to the effects of differing resolution between ATATS and NVSS on our ability to compare flux densities. We detect no transients at flux densities greater than 40 mJy in comparison with NVSS and place a 2$\sigma$ upper limit of 0.004 deg-2 on the transient rate for such sources. These results suggest that the gsim1 Jy transients reported by Matsumara et al. may not be true transients, but rather variable sources at their flux density threshold.},

However, the SK estimator in its original form must be developed from instantaneous power spectral density estimates, and hence cannot be employed as an RFI excision tool downstream of the data pipeline in existing instruments where any time averaging is performed. In this Letter, we develop a generalized estimator with wider applicability for both instantaneous and averaged spectral data, which extends its practical use to a much larger pool of radio instruments.},

abstract = {A new generation of radio telescopes is achieving unprecedented levels of sensitivity and resolution, as well as increased agility and field-of-view, by employing high-performance digital signal processing hardware to phase and correlate large numbers of antennas. The computational demands of these imaging systems scale in proportion to BMN^2, where B is the signal bandwidth, M is the number of independent beams, and N is the number of antennas. The specifications of many new arrays lead to demands in excess of tens of PetaOps per second. To meet this challenge, we have developed a general purpose correlator architecture using standard 10-Gbit Ethernet switches to pass data between flexible hardware modules containing Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chips. These chips are programmed using open-source signal processing libraries we have developed to be flexible, scalable, and chip-independent. This work reduces the time and cost of implementing a wide range of signal processing systems, with correlators foremost among them,and facilitates upgrading to new generations of processing technology. We present several correlator deployments, including a 16-antenna, 200-MHz bandwidth, 4-bit, full Stokes parameter application deployed on the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization.

No convincing candidate was detected in the survey, with a 10$\sigma$ detection threshold of ~10 $\mu$Jy achieved in two separate observing sessions. This survey represents a significant improvement over previous searches for pulsars at the GC and would have detected a significant fraction (gsim5%) of the pulsars around Sgr A*, if they had properties similar to those of the known population. Using our best current knowledge of the properties of the Galactic pulsar population and the scattering material toward Sgr A*, we estimate an upper limit of 90 normal pulsars in orbit within the central parsec of Sgr A*.},

abstract = {We study the field millisecond pulsar (MSP) population to infer its intrinsic distribution in spin period and luminosity and to determine its spatial distribution within the Galaxy. Our likelihood analysis on data from extant surveys (22 pulsars with periods less than 20 ms) accounts for the following important selection effects: (1) the survey sensitivity as a function of direction, spin period, and sky coverage; (2) interstellar scintillation, which modulates the pulsed flux and causes a net increase in search volume of ~30% and (3) errors in the pulsar distance scale. Adopting power-law models (with cutoffs) for the intrinsic distributions, the analysis yields a minimum-period cutoff Pmin > 0.65 ms (99% confidence), a period distribution proportional to P-2.0+/-0.33, and a pseudoluminosity distribution proportional to L^{-2.0+/-0.2}p (where Lp is the product of the flux density and the square of the distance, for Lp >= 1.1 mJy kpc2). We find that the column density of MSPs (uncorrected for beaming effects) is ~50^{+30}_{-20} kpc-2 in the vicinity of the solar system. For a Gaussian model, the z scale height is 0.65^{+0.16}_{-0.12} kpc, corresponding to the local number density 29^{+17}_{-11} kpc-3. (For an exponential model, the scale height becomes 0.50^{+0.19}_{-0.13} kpc, and the number density 44^{+25}_{-16} kpc-3.) Estimates of the total number of MSPs in the disk of the Galaxy and for the associated birthrate are given. The contribution of a diffuse halo-like component (tracing the Galactic spheroid, the halo, or the globular cluster density profile) to the local number density of MSPs is limited to <~1% of the midplane value. We consider a kinematic model for the MSP spatial distribution in which objects in the disk are kicked once at birth and then orbit in a smooth Galactic potential, becoming dynamically well-mixed. The analysis yields a column density 49^{+27}_{-17} kpc-2 (comparable to the above), a birth z kick velocity 52^{+17}_{-11} km s-1, and a three-dimensional velocity dispersion of ~84 km s-1. MSP velocities are smaller than those of young, long-period pulsars by about a factor of 5. The kinematic properties of the MSP population are discussed, including expected transverse motions, the occurrence of asymmetric drift, the shape of the velocity ellipsoid, and the z scale height at birth. If MSPs are long-lived, then a significant contribution to observed MSP z velocities is the result of diffusive processes that increase the scale height of old stellar populations; our best estimate of the one-dimensional velocity kick that is unique to MSP evolution is ~40 km s-1 if such diffusion is taken into account. The scale heights of millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries are consistent, suggesting a common origin and that the primary channel for forming both classes of objects imparts only low velocities. Binaries involving a common envelope phase and a neutron star--forming supernova explosion can yield such objects, even with explosion asymmetries like those needed to provide the velocity distribution of isolated, nonspun-up radio pulsars. Future searches for MSPs may be optimized using the model results. As an example, we give the expected number of detectable MSPs per beam area and the volumes of the Galaxy sampled per beam area for a hypothetical Green Bank Telescope all sky survey. Estimates for the volume that must be surveyed to find a pulsar faster than 1.5 ms are given. We also briefly discuss how selection effects associated with fast binaries influence our results.},

abstract = {We use astrometric, distance, and spindown data on pulsars to (1) estimate three-dimensional velocity components, birth distances from the Galactic plane, and ages of individual objects; (2) determine the distribution of space velocities and the scale height of pulsar progenitors; (3) test spindown laws for pulsars; (4) test for correlations between space velocities and other pulsar parameters; and (5) place empirical requirements on mechanisms than can produce high-velocity neutron stars. Our approach incorporates measurement errors, uncertainties in distances, deceleration in the Galactic potential, and differential Galactic rotation. We focus on a sample of proper motion measurements of young (<10 Myr) pulsars whose trajectories may be accurately and simply modeled. This sample of 49 pulsars excludes millisecond pulsars and other objects that may have undergone accretion-driven spinup. We estimate velocity components and birth z distance on a case-by-case basis assuming that the actual age equals the conventional spindown age for a braking index n = 3, no torque decay, and birth periods much shorter than present-day periods. Every sample member could have originated within 0.3 kpc of the Galactic plane while still having reasonable present-day peculiar radial velocities. For the 49 object sample, the scale height of the progenitors is ~0.13 kpc, and the three-dimensional velocities are distributed in two components with characteristic speeds of 175^+19_-24 km s^-1 and 700^+300_-132 km s^-1, representing ~86% and ~14% of the population, respectively. The sample velocities are inconsistent with a single-component Gaussian model and are well described by a two-component Gaussian model but do not require models of additional complexity. From the best-fit distribution, we estimate that about 20% of the known pulsars will escape the Galaxy, assuming an escape speed of 500 km s^-1. The best-fit, dual-component model, if augmented by an additional, low-velocity (<50 km s^-1) component, tolerates, at most, only a small extra contribution in number, less than 5%. The best three-component models do not show a preference for filling in the probability distribution at speeds intermediate to 175 and 700 km s^-1 but are nearly degenerate with the best two-component models. We estimate that the high-velocity tail (>1000 km s^-1) may be underrepresented (in the observed sample) by a factor ~2.3 owing to selection effects in pulsar surveys. The estimates of scale height and velocity parameters are insensitive to the explicit relation of chronological and spindown ages. A further analysis starting from our inferred velocity distribution allows us to test spindown laws and age estimates. There exist comparably good descriptions of the data involving different combinations of braking index and torque decay timescale. We find that a braking index of 2.5 is favored if torque decay occurs on a timescale of ~3 Myr, while braking indices ~4.5 +/- 0.5 are preferred if there is no torque decay. For the sample as a whole, the most probable chronological ages are typically smaller than conventional spindown ages by factors as large as 2. We have also searched for correlations between three-dimensional speeds of individual pulsars and combinations of spin period and period derivative. None appears to be significant. We argue that correlations identified previously between velocity and (apparent) magnetic moment reflect the different evolutionary paths taken by young, isolated (nonbinary), high-field pulsars and older, low-field pulsars that have undergone accretion-driven spinup. We conclude that any such correlation measures differences in spin and velocity selection in the evolution of the two populations and is not a measure of processes taking place in the core collapse that produces neutron stars in the first place. We assess mechanisms for producing high-velocity neutron stars, including disruption of binary systems by symmetric supernovae and neutrino, baryonic, or electromagnetic rocket effects during or shortly after the supernova. The largest velocities seen (~1600 km s^-1), along with the paucity of low-velocity pulsars, suggest that disruption of binaries by symmetric explosions is insufficient. Rocket effects appear to be a necessary and general phenomenon. The required kick amplitudes and the absence of a magnetic field-velocity correlation do not yet rule out any of the rocket models. However, the required amplitudes suggest that the core collapse process in a supernova is highly dynamic and aspherical and that the impulse delivered to the neutron star is larger than existing simulations of core collapse have achieved.},

abstract = {As the closest example of a galactic nucleus, the Galactic center presents an exquisite laboratory for learning about supermassive black holes (SMBH) and their environs. Detailed studies of stellar dynamics deep in the potential well of a galaxy, with exisiting and future large ground-based telescopes, offer several exciting directions in the coming decade. First, it will be possible to obtain precision measurements of the Galaxy's central potential, providing both a unique test of General Relativity (GR) and a detection of the extended dark matter distribution that is predicted to exist around the SMBH. Tests of gravity have not previously been possible on the mass scale of a SMBH. Similarly, only upper limits on the extended matter distribution on small scales currently exist; detection of dark matter on these scales is an important test of Lambda-CDM and the detection of stellar remnants would reveal a population that may dominate the stellar dynamics on the smallest scales. Second, our detailed view of the SMBH and its local gas and stellar environment provides insight into how SMBHs at the centers of galaxies form, grow and interact with their environs as well as on the exotic processes at work in the densest stellar clusters in the Universe. The key questions, still unanswered, of when and how SMBHs formed in the early universe, and the myriad ways in which feedback from SMBHs can affect structure formation, can be informed by directly observing the physical processes operating at the SMBH.},

abstract = {We report new precision measurements of the properties of our Galaxy's supermassive black hole. Based on astrometric (1995-2007) and radial velocity (RV; 2000-2007) measurements from the W. M. Keck 10 m telescopes, a fully unconstrained Keplerian orbit for the short-period star S0-2 provides values for the distance (R0) of 8.0+/-0.6 kpc, the enclosed mass (Mbh) of 4.1+/-0.6×106 Msolar, and the black hole's RV, which is consistent with zero with 30 km s-1 uncertainty. If the black hole is assumed to be at rest with respect to the Galaxy (e.g., has no massive companion to induce motion), we can further constrain the fit, obtaining R0=8.4+/-0.4 kpc and Mbh=4.5+/-0.4×106 Msolar. More complex models constrain the extended dark mass distribution to be less than 3-4×105 Msolar within 0.01 pc, ~100 times higher than predictions from stellar and stellar remnant models. For all models, we identify transient astrometric shifts from source confusion (up to 5 times the astrometric error) and the assumptions regarding the black hole's radial motion as previously unrecognized limitations on orbital accuracy and the usefulness of fainter stars. Future astrometric and RV observations will remedy these effects. Our estimates of R0 and the Galaxy's local rotation speed, which it is derived from combining R0 with the apparent proper motion of Sgr A*, ($\theta$0=229+/-18 km s-1), are compatible with measurements made using other methods. The increased black hole mass found in this study, compared to that determined using projected mass estimators, implies a longer period for the innermost stable orbit, longer resonant relaxation timescales for stars in the vicinity of the black hole and a better agreement with the Mbh-$\sigma$ relation.},

abstract = {We have obtained the first detection of spectral absorption lines in one of the high-velocity stars in the vicinity of the Galaxy's central supermassive black hole. Both Br$\gamma$ (2.1661 $\mu$m) and He I (2.1126 $\mu$m) are seen in absorption in S0-2 with equivalent widths (2.8+/-0.3 and 1.7+/-0.4 {\AA}) and an inferred stellar rotational velocity (220+/-40 km s-1) that are consistent with that of an O8-B0 dwarf, which suggests that it is a massive (~15 Msolar) young (less than 10 Myr) main-sequence star. This presents a major challenge to star formation theories, given the strong tidal forces that prevail over all distances reached by S0-2 in its current orbit (130-1900 AU) and the difficulty in migrating this star inward during its lifetime from farther out where tidal forces should no longer preclude star formation. The radial velocity measurements (z>=-510+/-40 km s-1) and our reported proper motions for S0-2 strongly constrain its orbit, providing a direct measure of the black hole mass of 4.1(+/-0.6)×106(R0/8 kpc)3 Msolar. The Keplerian orbit parameters have uncertainties that are reduced by a factor of 2-3 compared to previously reported values and include, for the first time, an independent solution for the dynamical center; this location, while consistent with the nominal infrared position of Sgr A*, is localized to a factor of 5 more precisely (+/-2 mas). Furthermore, the ambiguity in the inclination of the orbit is resolved with the addition of the radial velocity measurement, indicating that the star is behind the black hole at the time of closest approach and counterrevolving against the Galaxy. With further radial velocity measurements in the next few years, the orbit of S0-2 will provide the most robust estimate of the distance to the Galactic center.},

abstract = {We present the results of 16 years of monitoring stellar orbits around the massive black hole in the center of the Milky Way, using high-resolution near-infrared techniques. This work refines our previous analysis mainly by greatly improving the definition of the coordinate system, which reaches a long-term astrometric accuracy of ≈300 $\mu$as, and by investigating in detail the individual systematic error contributions. The combination of a long-time baseline and the excellent astrometric accuracy of adaptive optics data allows us to determine orbits of 28 stars, including the star S2, which has completed a full revolution since our monitoring began. Our main results are: all stellar orbits are fit extremely well by a single-point-mass potential to within the astrometric uncertainties, which are now ≈6× better than in previous studies. The central object mass is (4.31\, \pm\, 0.06|_\mathrm{stat}\,\pm\, 0.36|_{R_0})\times 10^6 M_\odot, where the fractional statistical error of 1.5% is nearly independent from R 0, and the main uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in R 0. Our current best estimate for the distance to the Galactic center is R 0 = 8.33 $\pm$ 0.35 kpc. The dominant errors in this value are systematic. The mass scales with distance as (3.95 $\pm$ 0.06) × 106(R 0/8 kpc)2.19 M sun. The orientations of orbital angular momenta for stars in the central arcsecond are random. We identify six of the stars with orbital solutions as late-type stars, and six early-type stars as members of the clockwise-rotating disk system, as was previously proposed. We constrain the extended dark mass enclosed between the pericenter and apocenter of S2 at less than 0.066, at the 99% confidence level, of the mass of Sgr A*. This is two orders of magnitudes larger than what one would expect from other theoretical and observational estimates.},

abstract = {The scattering diameters of Sgr A* and several nearby OH masers (~1" at 1 GHz) indicate that a region of enhanced scattering is along the line of sight to the Galactic center. This region of enhanced scattering implies that radio pulsars in or beyond the Galactic center will suffer pulse broadening of hundreds of seconds at 1 GHz. We have used the VLA at 1.4 GHz to survey the inner 2$\,^{\circ}$ of the Galactic center for radio pulsar candidates. Because of the large pulse broadening suffered by Galactic center radio pulsars, our strategy has been to identify compact radio sources, without regard to whether they are pulsed radio sources. We describe our survey and present the catalog of 170 sources. Comparison with other radio surveys of the area shows that just over half of these sources have not been detected previously; this same comparison reveals 29 sources that are not in higher frequency surveys, suggesting that the sources are either variable or steep spectrum, and a comparable number of sources in other surveys that should have been detected in this survey but were not. Comparison with infrared surveys shows that 59 (35%) sources have infrared counterparts and are likely to be H II regions. On the basis of the number of sources as yet unidentified, we estimate that there could have been no more than roughly 104-105 supernovae in the past several million years in the Galactic center. This estimate is consistent with the number required to produce the X-ray-emitting plasma in the Galactic center and is marginally consistent with that required to explain the 1.8 MeV emission from 26Al.},

A region of pronounced scattering (525 mas at 1.612 GHz) nearly centered on Sgr A* was found. Two interpretations for the enhanced scattering are presented. One hypothesis is that the scattering is due to a clump of enhanced turbulence, such as those that lie along lines of sight to other known objects, that has no physical relationship to the Galactic center. The other model considers the location of the enhanced scattering to arise in the Galactic center itself.

We find a significant increase in the specific frequency of X-ray sources, per unit stellar mass, within 1 arcmin from the centre of the galaxy. The radial distribution of surplus sources in this region follows the $\rho$2* law, suggesting that they are low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) formed dynamically in the dense inner bulge. We investigate dynamical formation of LMXBs, paying particular attention to the high-velocity regime characteristic for galactic bulges, which has not been explored previously. Our calculations suggest that the majority of the surplus sources are formed in tidal captures of black holes by main-sequence stars of low mass, M* <~ 0.3-0.4Msolar, with some contribution of neutron star (NS) systems of same type. Due to the small size of the accretion discs, a fraction of such systems may be persistent X-ray sources. Some of the sources may be ultracompact X-ray binaries with helium star/white dwarf companions. We also predict a large number of faint transients, both NS and BH systems, within ~1 arcmin from the M31 galactic centre. Finally, we consider the population of dynamically formed binaries in Galactic globular clusters, emphasizing the differences between these two types of stellar environments.},

The peak luminosities of the transients are intermediate between those typically considered outburst and quiescence for X-ray binaries. Remarkably, four of these transients lie within only 1 pc of Sgr A*. This implies that, compared to the numbers of similar systems located between 1 and 23 pc, transients are overabundant by a factor of >~20 per unit stellar mass within 1 pc of Sgr A*. It is likely that the excess transient X-ray sources are low-mass X-ray binaries that were produced, as in the cores of globular clusters, by three-body interactions between binary star systems and either black holes or neutron stars that have been concentrated in the central parsec through dynamical friction. Alternatively, they could be high-mass X-ray binaries that formed among the young stars that are present in the central parsec.},

abstract = {We investigate the possibility of identifying massive objects (lenses) in the Galactic Center region (GC) by means of pulsar timing. The well known intensity change due to microlensing is found to be less important. For typical stellar masses, the flux magnification can be significant only if the lens passes very close to the pulsar-Earth axis. We show that in the case of a pulsar the varying travel-time delay, which is observable because of the pulsating nature of pulsar radiation, is a much more powerful tool to investigate mass distributions in the GC. We find that a travel-time delay is measurable even for rather large distances between the lens and the pulsar-Earth axis. The time varying travel-time delay can be used to determine the mass of the lens and the ratio of the transverse velocity to the minimum impact parameter. Based on Monte Carlo simulations of synthetic data sets we give the expected accuracies in the parameter determination for various masses. We argue that pulsars found behind the very center of our Galaxy would provide an excellent opportunity to test the mass distribution in the Galactic nucleus, and therefore to distinguish between a super massive black hole (SMBH) and a super-dense star cluster (SDSC) within the central 0.1pc.},

abstract = {The supermassive black hole at the Galactic center harbors a bound cluster of massive stars that should leave neutron-star remnants. Extrapolating from the available data, we estimate that 100-1000 radio pulsars may presently orbit Sgr A* with periods of <~100 yr. Optimistically, 1-10 of the most luminous of these pulsars may be detectable with current telescopes in periodicity searches at frequencies near 10 GHz, where the effects of interstellar scattering are alleviated. Long-term timing observations of such a pulsar would clearly reveal its Keplerian motion, and possibly show the effects of relativistic gravity. We briefly discuss how pulsar timing can be used to study the dynamical and interstellar environment of the central black hole, and speculate on the prospects for astrometric observations of an orbiting pulsar.

abstract = {The spin and quadrupole moment of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic center can in principle be measured via astrometric monitoring of stars orbiting at milliparsec distances, allowing tests of general relativistic ``no-hair''theorems . One complicating factor is the presence of perturbations from other stars, which may induce orbital precession of the same order of magnitude as that due to general relativistic effects. The expected number of stars in this region is small enough that full N-body simulations can be carried out. We present the results of a comprehensive set of such simulations, which include a post-Newtonian treatment of spin-orbit effects. A number of possible models for the distribution of stars and stellar remnants are considered. We find that stellar perturbations are likely to obscure the signal due to frame dragging for stars beyond ˜0.5mpc from the black hole, while measurement of the quadrupole moment is likely to require observation of stars inside ˜0.2mpc. A high fraction of stellar remnants, e.g. 10M{\&}sun; black holes, in this region would make tests of general relativity problematic at all radii. We discuss the possibility of separating the effects of stellar perturbations from those due to general relativity.},

abstract = {We discuss physical experiments achievable via the monitoring of stellar dynamics near the massive black hole at the Galactic center with a diffraction-limited, next-generation, extremely large telescope (ELT). Given the likely observational capabilities of an ELT and what is currently known about the stellar environment at the Galactic center, we synthesize plausible samples of stellar orbits around the black hole. We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to evaluate the constraints that the monitoring of these orbits will place on the matter content within the dynamical sphere of influence of the black hole. We express our results as functions of the number N of stars with detectable orbital motions and the astrometric precision $\delta$$\theta$ and spectroscopic precision $\delta$v at which the stellar proper motions and radial velocities are monitored. Our results are easily scaled to different telescope sizes and precisions. For N=100, $\delta$$\theta$=0.5mas, and $\delta$v=10kms-1 (a conservative estimate of the capabilities of a 30 m telescope) we find that if the extended matter distribution enclosed by the orbits at 0.01 pc has a mass greater than ~103 Msolar, it will produce measurable deviations from Keplerian motion. Thus, if the concentration of dark matter at the Galactic center matches theoretical predictions, its influence on the orbits will be detectable. We also estimate the constraints that will be placed on the mass of the black hole and on the distance to the Galactic center and find that both will be measured to better than ~0.1%. We discuss the significance of knowing the distance to within a few parsecs and the importance of this parameter for understanding the structure of the Galaxy. We demonstrate that the lowest order relativistic effects, such as the prograde precession, will be detectable if $\delta$$\theta$<~0.5mas. Barring the favorable discovery of a star on a highly compact, eccentric orbit, the higher order effects, including the frame dragging due to the spin of the black hole, will require $\delta$$\theta$<~0.05mas. Finally, we calculate the rate at which monitored stars experience detectable nearby encounters with background stars. The encounters probe the mass function of stellar remnants that accumulate near the black hole. We find that ~30 such encounters will be detected over a 10 yr baseline for $\delta$$\theta$=0.5mas.},

abstract = {For radio pulsars in orbit with a compact companion, pulsar timing observations have proved to be a powerful tool for identifying the physical nature of the companion. Unfortunately, perhaps the most intriguing system where such a tool could be used, a pulsar in orbit with a black hole, has yet to be discovered. In this paper we give a detailed investigation of what one can learn about the black hole companion via timing observations of the pulsar. We present an analytic calculation for the propagation delay caused by the frame-dragging effect and show that it has the same functional behavior as the modulation of the observed rotational phase of the pulsar caused by the deflection of the radio signals in the gravitational field of the companion (bending delay). Thus, contrary to statements of other authors, the frame-dragging delay is unlikely to be separately measurable in pulsar binaries where the companion is a stellar-mass black hole. We demonstrate, however, that the precession of the binary orbit caused by the relativistic spin-orbit coupling can lead to observable effects that can be used to set a lower limit to the black hole spin or possibly allow the determination of its magnitude and orientation. We give parameter estimates for two possible systems, a 10 M_solar black hole in orbit either with a young (~0.1 s) pulsar or with a millisecond pulsar. Finally, we discuss the measurability of the quadrupole moment of the rotating black hole companion that would test the presence of a Kerr black hole. As an interesting side result of our calculations, we can give a further argument why the companion of PSR J0045-7319 cannot be a Kerr black hole.},

Astrometric observations of the orbits of at least two such stars can in principle lead to a determination of the angular momentum vector J of the black hole and its quadrupole moment Q2. This could lead to a test of the general relativistic no-hair theorems, which demand that Q2=-J2/M. Future high-precision adaptive infrared optics instruments may make such a fundamental test of the black hole paradigm possible.},

abstract = {A pulsar beam passing close to a black hole can provide a probe of very strong gravitational fields even if the pulsar itself is not in a strong field region. In the case that the spin of the hole can be ignored, we have previously shown that all strong field effects on the beam can be understood in terms of two "universal" functions: F(phiin) and T(phiin) of the angle of beam emission phiin; these functions are universal in that they depend only on a single parameter, the pulsar/black hole distance from which the beam is emitted. Here we apply this formalism to general pulsar-hole-observer geometries, with arbitrary alignment of the pulsar spin axis and arbitrary pulsar beam direction and angular width. We show that the analysis of the observational problem has two distinct elements: (1) the computation of the location and trajectory of an observer-dependent "keyhole" direction of emission in which a signal can be received by the observer; and (2) the determination of an annulus that represents the set of directions containing beam energy. Examples of each are given along with an example of a specific observational scenario.},

abstract = {If a pulsar orbits a supermassive black hole, the timing of pulses that pass close to the hole will show a variety of strong field effects. To compute the intensity and timing of pulses that have passed close to a nonrotating black hole, we introduce here a simple formalism based on two "universal functions," one for the bending of photon trajectories and the other for the photon travel time on these trajectories. We apply this simple formalism to the case of a pulsar in circular orbit that beams its pulses into the orbital plane. In addition to the "primary" pulses that reach the receiver by a more-or-less direct path, we find that there are secondary and higher-order pulses. These are usually much dimmer than the primary pulses, but they can be of comparable or even greater intensity if they are emitted when pulsar is on the side of the hole furthest from the receiver. We show that there is a phase relationship of the primary and secondary pulses that is a probe of the strongly curved spacetime geometry. Analogs of these phenomena are expected in more general configurations, in which a pulsar in orbit around a hole emits pulses that are not confined to the orbital plane.},

abstract = {With ``Earth 2000'' technology we could generate a directed laser pulse that outshines the broadband visible light of the Sun by 4 orders of magnitude. This is a conservative lower bound for the technical capability of a communicating civilization; optical interstellar communication is thus technically plausible. We have built a pair of systems to detect nanosecond pulsed optical signals from a target list that includes some 13,000 Sun-like stars, and we have made some 16,000 observations totaling nearly 2400 hr during five years of operation. A beam splitter-fed pair of hybrid avalanche photodetectors at the 1.5 m Wyeth Telescope at the Harvard/Smithsonian Oak Ridge Observatory (Agassiz Station) triggers on a coincident pulse pair, initiating measurement of pulse width and intensity at subnanosecond resolution. An identical system at the 0.9 m Cassegrain at Princeton's Fitz-Randolph Observatory performs synchronized observations with 0.1 $\mu$s event timing, permitting unambiguous identification of even a solitary pulse. Among the 11,600 artifact-free observations at Harvard, the distribution of 274 observed events shows no pattern of repetition, and is consistent with a model with uniform event rate, independent of target. With one possible exception (HIP 107395), no valid event has been seen simultaneously at the two observatories. We describe the search and candidate events and set limits on the prevalence of civilizations transmitting intense optical pulses.},

The relatively long periods (0.98-1.48 s) most likely reflect strong selection against short-period pulsars from radio-wave scattering at the observation frequency of 2 GHz used in our survey with the Green Bank Telescope. One object (PSR J1746-2850I) has a characteristic spindown age of only 13 kyr along with a high surface magnetic field ~4 × 1013 G. It and a second object found in the same telescope pointing, PSR J1746-2850II (which has the highest known DM among pulsars), may have originated from recent star formation in the Arches or Quintuplet clusters given their angular locations. Along with a third object, PSR J1745-2910, and two similar high-dispersion, long-period pulsars reported by Johnston et al., the five objects found so far are 10-15 arcmin from Sgr A*, consistent with there being a large pulsar population in the Galactic center, most of whose members are undetectable in relatively low-frequency surveys because of pulse broadening from the same scattering volume that angularly broadens Sgr A* and OH/IR masers.},

abstract = {We investigate the birth and evolution of Galactic isolated radio pulsars. We begin by estimating their birth space velocity distribution from proper-motion measurements of Brisken and coworkers. We find no evidence for multimodality of the distribution and favor one in which the absolute one-dimensional velocity components are exponentially distributed and with a three-dimensional mean velocity of 380+40-60 km s-1. We then proceed with a Monte Carlo-based population synthesis, modeling the birth properties of the pulsars, their time evolution, and their detection in the Parkes and Swinburne Multibeam surveys. We present a population model that appears generally consistent with the observations. Our results suggest that pulsars are born in the spiral arms, with a galactocentric radial distribution that is well described by the functional form proposed by Yusifov {\&} K{\"u}{\c c}{\"u}k, in which the pulsar surface density peaks at radius ~3 kpc. The birth spin period distribution extends to several hundred milliseconds, with no evidence of multimodality. Models that assume the radio luminosities of pulsars to be independent of the spin periods and period derivatives are inadequate, as they lead to the detection of too many old simulated pulsars in our simulations. Dithered radio luminosities proportional to the square root of the spin-down luminosity accommodate the observations well and provide a natural mechanism for the pulsars to dim uniformly as they approach the death line, avoiding an observed pileup on the latter. There is no evidence for significant torque decay (due to magnetic field decay or otherwise) over the lifetime of the pulsars as radio sources (~100 Myr). Finally, we estimate the pulsar birthrate and total number of pulsars in the Galaxy.},

It is found that: (1) the H2O and 1665-MHz masing regions are well-separated and occupy two distinct regions of space in all three H II regions observed; (2) the 1667-MHz OH maser features in W49 N show a strong velocity gradient across the source, suggesting the presence of a rotating and collapsing or expanding cloud; and (3) the OH and H2O emissions in W49 N apparently arise from the same system, which is identified as a large cloud in which star formation is taking place. A lower limit of about 6000 solar masses is estimated for this cloud, indicating that W49 N may be a cluster of protostars.},

The signal power was recorded simultaneously at 600, 1650, and 4850 MHz via direct sampling of the received signals in the total receiver bandwidth without any compensation for interstellar dispersion. In total, 1117 and 352 giant pulses were detected at 600 and 4850 MHz, respectively. The frequency band centered at 1650 MHz was contaminated by interference, and was used only to identify events found in other frequency bands. The cumulative energy distribution of the giant pulses follows a power law at 600 and 4850 MHz up to the highest energies. A deep modulation in the radio spectra of individual giant pulses was observed on both large ($\Delta$ v/v ≈ 0.5) and small ($\Delta$ v/v ≈ (2‑4) × 10‑3) frequency scales. The simultaneous appearance of giant pulses at the interpulse longitudes at high (4850 MHz) and low (1650 and/or 600 MHz) frequencies testifies to their common origin, in spite of the observed differences in other parameters.},

We also examine existing radio surveys for transients with a timescale of 1 yr and use these to set a 2$\sigma$ upper limit on the rate of tidal disruption events producing relativistic jets of ~14 × 10-7 Mpc-3 yr-1. This rate is an order of magnitude lower than the highest values from theoretical models and is consistent with detection rates from optical and X-ray surveys.},

abstract = {The Crab pulsar is well-known for its anomalous giant radio pulse emission. Past studies have concentrated only on the very bright pulses or were insensitive to the faint end of the giant pulse luminosity distribution. With our new instrumentation offering a large bandwidth and high time resolution combined with the narrow radio beam of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT), we seek to probe the weak giant pulse emission regime. The WSRT was used in a phased array mode, resolving a large fraction of the Crab nebula. The resulting pulsar signal was recorded using the PuMa II pulsar backend and then coherently dedispersed and searched for giant pulse emission. After careful flux calibration, the data were analysed to study the giant pulse properties. The analysis includes the distributions of the measured pulse widths, intensities, energies, and scattering times. The weak giant pulses are shown to form a separate part of the intensity distribution. The large number of giant pulses detected were used to analyse scattering and scintillation in giant pulses. We report for the first time the detection of giant pulse emission at both the main- and interpulse phases within a single rotation period. The rate of detection is consistent with the appearance of pulses at either pulse phase as being independent. These pulse pairs were used to examine the scintillation timescales within a single pulse period.},

abstract = {If the stellar population of the bulge contains black holes formed in the final core collapse of ordinary stars with M \ga 30 M_{\odot}, then about 25,000 stellar mass black holes should have migrated by dynamical friction into the central parsec of the Milky Way, forming a black hole cluster around the central supermassive black hole. These black holes can be captured by the central black hole when they randomly reach a highly eccentric orbit due to relaxation, either by direct capture (when their Newtonian peribothron is less than 4 Schwarzschild radii), or after losing orbital energy through gravitational waves. The overall depletion timescale is ~ 30 Gyr, so most of the 25,000 black holes remain in the central cluster today. The presence of this black hole cluster would have several observable consequences. First, the low-mass, old stellar population should have been expelled from the region occupied by the black hole cluster due to relaxation, implying a core in the profile of solar-mass red giants with a radius of ~ 2 pc (i.e., 1'). The observed central density cusp (which has a core radius of only a few arc seconds) should be composed primarily of young (\la 1 Gyr) stars. Second, flares from stars being captured by supermassive black holes in other galaxies should be rarer than usually expected because the older stars will have been expelled from the central regions by the black hole clusters of those galaxies. Third, the young (\la 2 Gyr) stars found at distances ~ 3 - 10 pc from the Galactic center should be preferentially on highly eccentric orbits. Fourth, if future high-resolution $K$-band images reveal sources microlensed by the Milky Way's central black hole, then the cluster black holes could give rise to secondary (``planet-like'') perturbations on the main event.},

abstract = {Simultaneous multifrequency observations of Crab pulsar giant pulses (GPs) were performed with the 64-m Kalyazin radio telescope at four frequency ($\nu$ = 0.6, 1.4, 2.2, and 8.3 GHz) using the K5 VLBI recording terminal. The K5 terminal provided continuous recording in 16 × 4-MHz wide frequency channels distributed over 4 frequency bands. Several thousand GPs were detected during about 6 hours of observations on two successive days in 2005 July. The radio spectra of single GPs were analyzed at separate frequencies and over the whole frequency range. These spectra manifest notable modulation over the frequency ranges, $\Delta$$\nu$, both on large ($\Delta$$\nu$/$\nu$ ≈ 0.5) and small ($\Delta$$\nu$/$\nu$ ≈ 0.01) frequency scales. A cross-correlation analysis of GPs at 2.2 GHz showed that their pulse shapes can be interpreted as being an ensemble of unresolved bursts grouped together on time scales of ≈1$\mu$s, being well-correlated over a 60-MHz band. The corresponding GP cross-correlation functions do not obey the predictions of the amplitude-modulated noise model of <A >Rickett(1975)</A>, thus indicating that unresolved components represent a small number of elementary emitters.},

abstract = {PSR B0540-69 is one of a small handful of pulsars known to emit giant pulses and the only extra-galactic pulsar known to do so. We observed the pulsar for a total of 72 h over a 6 month interval and detected 141 giant pulses. We have obtained correct phasing between the radio arrival times of the giant pulses and the X-ray pulse profile. The giant pulses occur in two phase windows, located 6.7 ms before and 5.0 ms after the mid-point of the X-ray profile. We have detected the integrated profile of the pulsar at 1.4 GHz with a flux density of only 24 $\mu$Jy. The statistics of the giant pulses are clearly power law and it is likely that the giant pulses contribute only a few per cent of the integrated pulse flux density, similar to other pulsars with giant pulse emission. Simultaneous X-ray and radio observations show no significant increase in the X-ray flux at the time of the radio giants. The relative enhancements in the X-ray emission must be at least 5.5 times smaller than in the radio emission.},

abstract = {Giant radio pulses of the millisecond pulsar B1937+21 were recorded with the S2 VLBI system at 1.65 GHz with NASA/JPL's 70 m radio telescope at Tidbinbilla, Australia. These pulses have been observed as strong as 65,000 Jy with widths <=15 ns, corresponding to a brightness temperature of Tb>=5×1039 K, the highest observed in the universe. The vast majority of these pulses occur in 5.8 and 8.2 $\mu$s windows at the very trailing edges of the regular main pulse and interpulse profiles, respectively. Giant pulses occur, in general, with a single spike. Only in one case of 309 was the structure clearly more complex. The cumulative distribution is fitted by a power law with index -1.40+/-0.01 with a low-energy but no high-energy cutoff. We estimate that giant pulses occur frequently but are only rarely detected. When corrected for the directivity factor, 25 giant pulses are estimated to be generated in one neutron star revolution alone. The intensities of the giant pulses of the main pulses and interpulses are not correlated with each other nor with the intensities or energies of the main pulses and interpulses themselves. Their radiation energy density can exceed 300 times the plasma energy density at the surface of the neutron star and can even exceed the magnetic field energy density at that surface. We therefore do not think that the generation of giant pulses is linked to the plasma mechanisms in the magnetosphere. Instead we suggest that it is directly related to discharges in the polar cap region of the pulsar.},

Spherically symmetric hydrodynamic calculations show that ~ 1 % of this gas, or ~ 10^{-5} solar masses/year, flows in towards the central massive black hole Sgr A*; the remaining gas, ~ 10^{-3} solar masses/year, is thermally driven out of the central star cluster in a wind. This dynamical model accounts for the level of diffuse X-ray emission observed in the Galactic Center by Chandra and the extended X-ray source coincident with Sgr A*; the latter is a direct signature of gas being gravitational captured by the black hole.

There are 1235 planetary candidates with transit like signatures detected in this period. These are associated with 997 host stars. Distributions of the characteristics of the planetary candidates are separated into five class-sizes; 68 candidates of approximately Earth-size (radius < 1.25 Earth radii), 288 super-Earth size (1.25 Earth radii < radius < 2 Earth radii), 662 Neptune-size (2 Earth radii < radius < 6 Earth radii), 165 Jupiter-size (6 Earth radii < radius < 15 Earth radii), and 19 up to twice the size of Jupiter (15 Earth radii < radius < 22 Earth radii). In the temperature range appropriate for the habitable zone, 54 candidates are found with sizes ranging from Earth-size to larger than that of Jupiter. Five are less than twice the size of the Earth. Over 74% of the planetary candidates are smaller than Neptune. The observed number versus size distribution of planetary candidates increases to a peak at two to three times Earth-size and then declines inversely proportional to area of the candidate. Our current best estimates of the intrinsic frequencies of planetary candidates, after correcting for geometric and sensitivity biases, are 6% for Earth-size candidates, 7% for super-Earth size candidates, 17% for Neptune-size candidates, and 4% for Jupiter-size candidates. Multi-candidate, transiting systems are frequent; 17% of the host stars have multi-candidate systems, and 33.9% of all the candidates are part of multi-candidate systems. },

The white noise level is around 1.5 microK.degree or less in the 3 main CMB channels (100-217GHz). The photometric accuracy is better than 2% at frequencies lower or equal to 353GHz, and around 7% at the two highest frequencies. The maps created by the HFI Data Processing Centre reach our goals in terms of sensitivity, resolution, and photometric accuracy. They are already sufficiently accurate and well-characterised to allow scientific analyses which are presented in an accompanying series of early papers. At this stage, HFI data appears to be of high quality and we expect that with further refinements of the data processing we should be able to achieve, or exceed, the science goals of the project.},

abstract = {Context. The High Frequency Instrument (HFI) is one of the two focal instruments of the Planck mission. It will observe the whole sky in six bands in the 100 GHz-1 THz range. Aims: The HFI instrument is designed to measure the cosmic microwave background (CMB) with a sensitivity limited only by fundamental sources: the photon noise of the CMB itself and the residuals left after the removal of foregrounds. The two high frequency bands will provide full maps of the submillimetre sky, featuring mainly extended and point source foregrounds. Systematic effects must be kept at negligible levels or accurately monitored so that the signal can be corrected. This paper describes the HFI design and its characteristics deduced from ground tests and calibration. Methods: The HFI instrumental concept and architecture are feasible only by pushing new techniques to their extreme capabilities, mainly: (i) bolometers working at 100 mK and absorbing the radiation in grids; (ii) a dilution cooler providing 100 mK in microgravity conditions; (iii) a new type of AC biased readout electronics and (iv) optical channels using devices inspired from radio and infrared techniques. Results: The Planck-HFI instrument performance exceeds requirements for sensitivity and control of systematic effects. During ground-based calibration and tests, it was measured at instrument and system levels to be close to or better than the goal specification.},

abstract = {A radio frequency interference (RFI) excision algorithm based on spectral kurtosis, a spectral variant of time-domain kurtosis, is proposed and implemented in software. The algorithm works by providing a robust estimator for Gaussian noise that, when violated, indicates the presence of non-Gaussian RFI. A theoretical formalism is used that unifies the well-known time-domain kurtosis estimator with past work related to spectral kurtosis, and leads naturally to a single expression encompassing both. The algorithm accumulates the first two powers of M power spectral density (PSD) estimates, obtained via Fourier transform, to form a spectral kurtosis (SK) estimator whose expected statistical variance is used to define an RFI detection threshold. The performance of the algorithm is theoretically evaluated for different time-domain RFI characteristics and signal-to-noise ratios $\eta$. The theoretical performance of the algorithm for intermittent RFI (RFI present in R out of M PSD estimates) is evaluated and shown to depend greatly on the duty cycle, d=R/M. The algorithm is most effective for d=1/(4+$\eta$), but cannot distinguish RFI from Gaussian noise at any $\eta$ when d=0.5. The expected efficiency and robustness of the algorithm are tested using data from the newly designed FASR Subsystem Testbed radio interferometer operating at the Owens Valley Solar Array. The ability of the algorithm to discriminate RFI against the temporally and spectrally complex radio emission produced during solar radio bursts is demonstrated.},

abstract = {In this paper we demonstrate that a large, unexplored reservoir of information about pulsar emission exists, that is directly linked to the radiating particles and their radiation process: We present a study of flux density measurements of individual pulses simultaneously observed at four different frequencies. Correcting for effects caused by the interstellar medium, we derive intrinsic flux density spectra of individual radio pulses observed at several frequencies for the first time. Pulsar B0329+54 was observed at 238, 626, 1412 and 4850 MHz, while observations of PSR B1133+16 were made at 341, 626, 1412 and 4850 MHz. We derive intrinsic pulse-to-pulse modulation indices which show a minimum around 1 GHz. Correlations between the flux densities of different frequency pairs worsen as the frequency separation widens and also tend to be worse for outer profile components. The single pulse spectra of PSR B0329+54 resemble the spectra of the integrated profile. However, the spectral index distributions for the single pulses of PSR B1133+16 show significant deviations from a Gaussian. This asymmetry is caused by very strong pulses with flux densities exceeding the mean value by more than a factor of ten. These strong pulses occur preferentially at the trailing edge of the leading component and appear to be broadband in most cases. Their properties are similar to those of so-called giant pulses, suggesting that these phenomena are related.},

abstract = {Applying the well-known physics of plasma and the theory of first order phase transitions, in particular the known physics of the instability called Spinodal Decomposition, a unique "Strong" Magnetic Field physical model (SMF) explains the origin of a large-scale primordial magnetic field in each DeVaucoleurs Supercluster. The strength of the long-range Electromotive Force is about 10exp40 times stronger than Gravity. Thus, the existence of observed magnetic fields in clusters of galaxies, galaxies, quasars, stars is explained. SMF processes occur at and soon after Combination Time, when the CMB (cosmic microwave background) appears, in the Big Bang model of the Universe. SMF leads to a physical model (Astro-ph0509223) where Gravity continues to attract matter into relatively thin sheets of matter around huge voids, which matches the famous observations of John Huchra and Margaret Geller (Harvard/SAO). Eventually, at some local volume, critical density for gravitational collapse of a cloud along the Supercluster's "shell" is reached and galaxies/quasars begin forming. SMF argues for a new classification of galaxies/quasars by the ratio of magnetic energy to rotational energy in the particular object. However the activity we observe is also a function of the matter accretion rate at the particular time observed. Also, applying SMF, a specific physical model (with an electric current Storage Ring) for the "Central Engine" (AGN) of galaxies, relevant to the formation of galactic spiral arms, jets and gamma ray bursts, is created. SMF embodies two novel concepts used in Nature for the production of electric current, both different from the Faraday/Henry discovery that powers our electric civilization. SMF agrees fully with the comment by Sir Martin Rees that "the phenomena of quasars and radio galaxies cannot be understood until they are placed in the general context of galactic evolution".},

abstract = {This paper addresses the first practical application of spatial filtering techniques to data taken with a multibeam receiver. Spatial filters make use of the relative arrival times of a signal at multiple sensors to identify and separate signals from different directions. The method is a consequence of the Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve theorem and relies on the eigen decomposition of the covariance matrix formed from the multiple signal paths. The effectiveness of the spatial filtering techniques is demonstrated on observations of the Vela pulsar taken with the Parkes 20 cm Multibeam receiver. The experiment was highly successful, and the results show spatial filtering methods provide powerful tools for interference mitigation with an array feed receiver. Extensions of the algorithm to reduce computational requirements and allow application on short (submillisecond) timescales are also explored.},

abstract = {The transmission rate of communication between radio telescopes on Earth and extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) has been calculated up to the distances 1000 light years. Phase-shift-keying (PSK) and frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation schemes are both considered here. It has been demonstrated that M-ary FSK is advantageous in terms of energy. Narrow-band pulses scattered over the spectrum can be the probable signals of ETI and modern SETI spectrum analyzers are well suited to searching for these types of signals. Such signals can be detected using the Hough transform which is a dedicated tool for detecting patterns on an image. The time-frequency plane representing the power output of the spectrum analyzer during the search for ETI gives an image from which the Hough transform (HT) can detect signal patterns with frequency drift.},

abstract = {DURING an investigation of the short-term behaviour of the radiation coming from pulsars during strong bursts, several objects were found to exhibit pulse nulling phenomena. This was first noted on analogue records of the pulsar radiation intensity where the pen deflexions are a rough measure of the pulse energy. PSR's 0834 + 06, 1133 + 16, 1237 + 25 and 1929 + 10 were found suddenly to miss from one to ten pulses at various times, termed ``nulls'', during otherwise very strong and steady bursts. A null means that the pulse energy decreased by a factor of ten or more over one or two pulse periods and then increased just as sharply after the null. The nulls can be divided into two types according to their duration and their spacing. Type I nulls are the most prominent with a width between three and ten pulses and recur with spacings of about fifty pulses. Type II nulls have a width of only one or two pulses and recur with spacings of three to ten pulses. Pulse sequences from 1133 + 16 and 1237 + 25 and possibly 0834 + 06 contain the Type I nulls while sequences from all four objects contain Type II nulls. A quick look at the spacings of these nulls suggests that they may recur periodically and hence contribute to responses at characteristic periods in pulse energy fluctuation power spectra. This possibility has been reported indirectly by Sutton et al.1 and Hesse2 for the Type II nulls in 0834 + 06 and directly by Lang3 for Type I nulls in 1133 + 16 and 1237 + 25.},

The expected rate of such hyperflares, $\sim$ 20 - 100 d$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$, is in good correspondence with the value estimated by Lorimer et al. The possible mechanism of radio emission can be related to the tearing mode instability in the magnetar magnetosphere as discussed by Lyutikov (2002), and can produce the radio flux corresponding to the observed $\sim$ 30 Jy from the mERB using a simple scaling of the burst energy.},

These observations span 23 years and include 1852 epochs at 1.4 GHz in the C and D configurations. We find no transients in the field. The sensitivity of the observations is limited by dynamic range effects in the images. At large flux densities (>0.2 Jy), single-epoch observations provide a strong limit on the transient surface density. At flux densities near the dynamic range threshold, we use the requirement that transient sources must appear in consecutive epochs to be confirmed as real. This sets the sensitivity at low flux densities to transient durations of $\tau$ ~ 1 day, while $\tau$>1 minute for high flux densities. At 70 mJy, we find a 2$\sigma$ limit on the surface density $\Sigma$ < 3 × 10-3 deg-2. At 3 Jy, we find a 2$\sigma$ limit $\Sigma$ < 9 × 10-4 deg-2. A future systematic search of the VLA archives can provide one to two orders of magnitude more sensitivity to RTs.},

abstract = {We report on radio observations of the M8.5 dwarf LSR J1835+3259 and the L3.5 dwarf 2MASS J00361617+1821104, which provide the strongest evidence to date that the electron cyclotron maser instability is the dominant mechanism producing radio emission in the magnetospheres of ultracool dwarfs. As has previously been reported for the M9 dwarf TVLM 513-46546, periodic pulses of 100% circularly polarized, coherent radio emission are detected from both dwarfs with periods of 2.84+/-0.01 and 3.08+/-0.05 hr, respectively, for LSR J1835+3259 and 2MASS J00361617+1821104. Importantly, periodic unpolarized radio emission is also detected from 2MASS J00361617+1821104, and brightness temperature limitations rule out gyrosynchrotron radiation as a source of this radio emission. The unpolarized emission from this and other ultracool dwarfs is also attributed to electron cyclotron maser emission, which has become depolarized on traversing the ultracool dwarf magnetosphere, possibly due to propagations effects such as scattering. Based on available vsini data in the literature and rotation periods derived from the periodic radio data for the three confirmed sources of electron cyclotron maser emission, TVLM 513-46546, LSR J1835+3259, and 2MASS J00361617+1821104, we determine that the rotation axes of all three dwarfs are close to perpendicular to our line of sight. This suggests a possible geometrical selection effect due to the inherent directivity of electron cyclotron maser emission, that may account for the previously reported relationship between radio activity and vsini observed for ultracool dwarfs. We also determine the radius of the dwarf LSR J1835+3259 to be >=0.117+/-0.012 Rsolar. The implied size of the radius, together with the bolometric luminosity of the dwarf, suggests that either LSR J1835 is a young- or intermediate-age brown dwarf, or that current theoretical models underestimate the radii of ultracool dwarfs.},

abstract = {The Pi GHz Sky Survey (PiGSS) is a key project of the Allen Telescope Array. PiGSS is a 3.1 GHz survey of radio continuum emission in the extragalactic sky with an emphasis on synoptic observations that measure the static and time-variable properties of the sky. During the 2.5 year campaign, PiGSS will twice observe ~250,000 radio sources in the 10,000 deg2 region of the sky with b>30$\,^{\circ}$ to an rms sensitivity of ~1 mJy. Additionally, sub-regions of the sky will be observed multiple times to characterize variability on timescales of days to years. We present here observations of a 10 deg2 region in the Bo{\"o}tes constellation overlapping the NOAO Deep Wide Field Survey field. The PiGSS image was constructed from 75 daily observations distributed over a 4 month period and has an rms flux density between 200 and 250 $\mu$Jy. This represents a deeper image by a factor of 4-8 than we will achieve over the entire 10,000 deg2. We provide flux densities, source sizes, and spectral indices for the 425 sources detected in the image. We identify ~100 new flat-spectrum radio sources; we project that when completed PiGSS will identify 104 flat-spectrum sources. We identify one source that is a possible transient radio source. This survey provides new limits on faint radio transients and variables with characteristic durations of months.},

We find 39 variable sources in a total survey area of 23.2 deg2. Correcting for various selection effects and for the extragalactic variable population of active galactic nuclei, we conclude there are ~1.6 deg-2 Galactic sources which vary by more than 50% on a time scale of years (or shorter). We show that these sources are much more highly variable than extragalactic objects; more than 50% show variability by a factor >2 compared to <10% for extragalactic objects in the same flux density range. We also show that the fraction of variable sources increases toward the Galactic center (another indication that this is a Galactic population), and that the spectral indices of many of these sources are flat or inverted. A small number of the variables are coincident with mid-IR sources and two are coincident with X-ray emitters, but most have no known counterparts at other wavelengths. Intriguingly, one lies at the center of a supernova remnant, while another appears to be a very compact planetary nebula; several are likely to represent activity associated with star formation regions. We discuss the possible source classes which could contribute to the variable cohort and follow-up observations which could clarify the nature of these sources.},

This region lies close to the Scutum spiral arm which is already known to contain a number of radio and X-ray pulsars. The search was nominally sensitive to pulsars with 1400-MHz flux densities above 0.3 mJy; this represents a threefold improvement in sensitivity over all previous searches of this region of the Galaxy. Four new long-period pulsars were discovered as a result of this survey. All three previously known pulsars in this region were also detected. The four new pulsars are relatively young (< 0.5 Myr), weak (<1 mJy) sources with dispersion measures in the range 170-910 cm-3 pc. None of the newly-discovered pulsars are associated with catalogued supernova remnants.},

abstract = {We describe observations of Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) that were discovered in a re-analysis of the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey (PMPS). The sources have now been monitored for sufficiently long to obtain seven new coherent timing solutions to make a total of 14 now known. Furthermore, we announce the discovery of seven new transient sources, one of which may be extragalactic in origin (with z˜ 0.1) and would then be a second example of the so-called `Lorimer burst'. The timing solutions allow us to infer neutron star characteristics such as energy-loss rate, magnetic field strength and evolutionary time-scales, as well as facilitating multiwavelength followup by providing accurate astrometry. All of this enables us to consider the question of whether or not RRATs are in any way special, i.e. a distinct and separate population of neutron stars, as has been previously suggested. We see no reason to consider `RRAT' as anything other than a detection label, the subject of a selection effect in the parameter space searched. However, single-pulse searches can be utilized to great effect to identify pulsars difficult, or impossible, to find by other means, in particular those with long periods (half of the PMPS RRATs have periods greater than 4 s), high magnetic field strengths (B≳ 1013 G) and pulsars approaching the `death valley'. The detailed nulling properties of such pulsars are unknown but the mounting evidence suggests a broad range of behaviour in the pulsar population. The group of RRATs fits in to the picture where pulsar magnetospheres switch between stable configurations.  Volume 415, Issue 4, pages 3065--3080, August 2011},

The values are in the range n˙0=100-1800 Gpc-3 yr-1 and n˙0=100-550 Gpc-3 yr-1, respectively, and their ratios to Type Ibc supernovae (SNe Ibc) are ~1%-9% and 0.4%-3%, respectively. These data may suggest the existence of two physically distinct classes of GRBs in which LL GRBs are (intrinsically) more frequent events than HL GRBs. However, with the present data, we cannot exclude the possibility of a single population of GRBs that gives rise to both an isotropic low-luminous emission (LL GRBs: detectable only in nearby GRBs) and to a highly collimated high luminous emission (HL GRBs: detectable preferentially at high z). We also compute the rate of SNe Ibc characterized by broad-lined spectra (hypernovae [HNe]) and find it to be about 1.5×10-4 yr-1 per 1010 LB,solar (i.e., less than 10% of SNe Ibc occurring in spiral galaxies). This result implies that the ratio of HL GRBs to HNe is smaller than 1, possibly in the range of 0.04-0.3. We have used the ratio between HNe and LL GRBs to constrain their beaming factor to f-1b~10 or less.},

abstract = {Image quality in mosaicked observations from interferometric radio telescopes is strongly dependent on the accuracy with which the antenna primary beam is calibrated. The next generation of radio telescope arrays such as the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) have key science goals that involve making large mosaicked observations filled with bright point sources. We present a new method for calibrating the shape of the telescope's mean primary beam that uses the multiple redundant observations of these bright sources in the mosaic. The method has an analytical solution for simple Gaussian beam shapes but can also be applied to more complex beam shapes through $\chi$2 minimization. One major benefit of this simple, conceptually clean method is that it makes use of the science data for calibration purposes, thus saving telescope time and improving accuracy through simultaneous calibration and observation. We apply the method both to 1.43 GHz data taken during the ATA Twenty Centimeter Survey (ATATS) and to 3.14 GHz data taken during the ATA's Pi Gigahertz Sky Survey (PiGSS). We find that the beam's calculated full width at half-maximum (FWHM) values are consistent with the theoretical values, the values measured by several independent methods, and the values from the simulation we use to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on data from future telescopes such as the expanded ATA and the SKA. These results are preliminary and can be expanded upon by fitting more complex beam shapes. We also investigate, by way of a simulation, the dependence of the accuracy of the telescope's FWHM on antenna number. We find that the uncertainty returned by our fitting method is inversely proportional to the number of antennas in the array.},

abstract = {We study the early dynamical evolution of young dense star clusters by using Monte Carlo simulations for systems with up to N=107 stars. Rapid mass segregation of massive main-sequence stars and the development of the Spitzer instability can drive these systems to core collapse in a small fraction of the initial half-mass relaxation time. If the core-collapse time is less than the lifetime of the massive stars, all stars in the collapsing core may then undergo a runaway collision process leading to the formation of a massive black hole. Here we study in detail the first step in this process, up to the occurrence of core collapse. We have performed about 100 simulations for clusters with a wide variety of initial conditions, varying systematically the cluster density profile, stellar initial mass function (IMF), and number of stars. We also considered the effects of initial mass segregation and stellar evolution mass loss. Our results show that, for clusters with a moderate initial central concentration and any realistic IMF, the ratio of core-collapse time to initial half-mass relaxation time is typically ~0.1, in agreement with the value previously found by direct N-body simulations for much smaller systems. Models with even higher central concentration initially, or with initial mass segregation (from star formation) have even shorter core collapse times. Remarkably, we find that, for all realistic initial conditions, the mass of the collapsing core is always close to ~10-3 of the total cluster mass, very similar to the observed correlation between central black hole mass and total cluster mass in a variety of environments. We discuss the implications of our results for the formation of intermediate-mass black holes in globular clusters and super star clusters, ultraluminous X-ray sources, and seed black holes in proto-galactic nuclei.},

Pulsar radio emission is a textbook example of this signal class, known as cyclostationary signals. In this paper, we discuss the application of cyclic spectral analysis methods to pulsar data, and compare the results with the traditional filterbank approaches used for almost all pulsar observations to date. In contrast to standard methods, the cyclic spectrum preserves phase information of the radio signal. This feature allows us to determine the impulse response of the interstellar medium and the intrinsic, unscattered pulse profile directly from a single observation. We illustrate these new analysis techniques using real data from an observation of the millisecond pulsar B1937+21.},

abstract = {This is the third paper of a series in which we present new measurements of the observed rates of supernovae (SNe) in the local Universe, determined from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). We have considered a sample of ˜1000 SNe and used an optimal subsample of 726 SNe (274 SNe Ia, 116 SNe Ibc and 324 SNe II) to determine our rates. We study the trend of the rates as a function of a few quantities available for our galaxy sample, such as luminosity in the B and K bands, stellar mass and morphological class. We discuss different choices (SN samples, input SN luminosity functions, inclination correction factors) and their effect on the rates and their uncertainties. A comparison between our SN rates and the published measurements shows that they are consistent with each other to within the uncertainties when the rate calculations are done in the same manner. Nevertheless, our data demonstrate that the rates cannot be adequately described by a single parameter using either galaxy Hubble types or B-K colours. A secondary parameter in galaxy 'size', expressed by luminosity or stellar mass, is needed to adequately describe the rates in the rate-size relation: the galaxies of smaller sizes have higher SN rates per unit mass or per unit luminosity. The trends of the SN rates in galaxies of different Hubble types and colours are discussed. We examine possible causes for the rate-size relation. Physically, such a relation for the core-collapse SNe is probably linked to the correlation between the specific star-formation rate and the galaxy sizes, but it is not clear whether the same link can be established for SNe Ia. We discuss the two-component ('tardy' and 'prompt') model for SN Ia rates, and find that the SN Ia rates in young stellar populations might have a strong correlation with the core-collapse SN rates. We derive volumetric rates for the different SN types [e.g. for SNe Ia, a rate of (0.301 $\pm$ 0.062) × 10-4 SN Mpc-3 yr-1 at redshift 0] and compare them to the measurements at different redshifts. Finally, we estimate the SN rate for the Milky Way Galaxy to be 2.84 $\pm$ 0.60 SNe per century (with a systematic uncertainty of a factor of ˜2), consistent with published SN rates based on several different techniques.},

abstract = {Recovery of the supernova (SN) delay-time distribution (DTD) - the SN rate versus time that would follow a hypothetical brief burst of star formation - can shed light on SN progenitors and physics, as well as on the time-scales of chemical enrichment. Previous attempts to reconstruct the DTD have been based either on comparison of mean SN rates versus redshift to cosmic star-formation history (SFH), or on the comparison of SN rates among galaxies with different mean ages. Here, we present an approach to recover the SN DTD that avoids the averaging and loss of information of other schemes. We compare the SFHs of individual galaxies to the numbers of SNe discovered by a survey in each galaxy (generally zero, sometimes one SN, rarely a few). We apply the method to a subsample of 3505 galaxies, hosting 82 type-Ia SNe (SNe Ia) and 119 core-collapse supernovae (CC SNe), from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS), that have SFHs reconstructed from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra. We find a >2$\sigma$ SN Ia DTD signal in our shortest-delay, 'prompt' bin at <420 Myr. We identify and study a systematic error, due to the limited aperture of the SDSS spectroscopic fibres, that causes some of the prompt signal to leak to the later bins of the DTD. After accounting for this systematic error, we demonstrate that a prompt SN Ia contribution is required by the data at the >99 per cent confidence level. We further find a 4$\sigma$ indication of SNe Ia that are 'delayed' by >2.4 Gyr. Thus, the data support the existence of both prompt and delayed SNe Ia. We measure the time integral over the SN DTD. For CC SNe we find a total yield of 0.010 $\pm$ 0.002 SNe per M{\.o} formed, in excellent agreement with expectations, if all stars more massive than 8 M{\.o} lead to visible SN explosions. This argues against scenarios in which the minimum mass for core-collapse SNe is ≳10 M{\.o}, or in which a significant fraction of massive stars collapse without an accompanying explosion. For SNe Ia, the time-integrated yield is 0.0023 $\pm$ 0.0006 SNe per M{\.o} formed, most of them with delays <2.4 Gyr. Finally, we show the robust performance of the method on simulated samples, and demonstrate that its application to already existing SN samples, such as the full LOSS sample, but with complete and unbiased SFH estimates for the survey galaxies, could provide an accurate and detailed measurement of the SN Ia DTD.},

abstract = {This is the second paper of a series in which we present new measurements of the observed rates of supernovae (SNe) in the local Universe, determined from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). In this paper, a complete SN sample is constructed, and the observed (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction) luminosity functions (LFs) of SNe are derived. These LFs solve two issues that have plagued previous rate calculations for nearby SNe: the luminosity distribution of SNe and the host-galaxy extinction. We select a volume-limited sample of 175 SNe, collect photometry for every object and fit a family of light curves to constrain the peak magnitudes and light-curve shapes. The volume-limited LFs show that they are not well represented by a Gaussian distribution. There are notable differences in the LFs for galaxies of different Hubble types (especially for SNe Ia). We derive the observed fractions for the different subclasses in a complete SN sample, and find significant fractions of SNe II-L (10 per cent), IIb (12 per cent) and IIn (9 per cent) in the SN II sample. Furthermore, we derive the LFs and the observed fractions of different SN subclasses in a magnitude-limited survey with different observation intervals, and find that the LFs are enhanced at the high-luminosity end and appear more 'standard' with smaller scatter, and that the LFs and fractions of SNe do not change significantly when the observation interval is shorter than 10 d. We also discuss the LFs in different galaxy sizes and inclinations, and for different SN subclasses. Some notable results are that there is not a strong correlation between the SN LFs and the host-galaxy size, but there might be a preference for SNe IIn to occur in small, late-type spiral galaxies. The LFs in different inclination bins do not provide strong evidence for extreme extinction in highly inclined galaxies, though the sample is still small. The LFs of different SN subclasses show significant differences. We also find that SNe Ibc and IIb come from more luminous galaxies than SNe II-P, while SNe IIn come from less luminous galaxies, suggesting a possible metallicity effect. The limitations and applications of our LFs are also discussed.},

abstract = {This is the first paper of a series in which we present new measurements of the observed rates of supernovae (SNe) in the local Universe, determined from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search. We have obtained 2.3 million observations of 14 882 sample galaxies over an interval of 11 years (1998 March to 2008 December). We considered 1036 SNe detected in our sample and used an optimal subsample of 726 SNe (274 Type Ia SNe, 116 Type Ibc SNe and Type II 324 SNe) to determine our SN rates. This is the largest and most homogeneous set of nearby SNe ever assembled for this purpose, and ours is the first local SN rate analysis based on CCD imaging and modern image-subtraction techniques. In this paper, we lay the foundation of the study. We derive the recipe for the control-time calculation for SNe with a known luminosity function and provide details on the construction of the galaxy and SN samples used in the calculations. Compared with a complete volume-limited galaxy sample, our sample has a deficit of low-luminosity galaxies but still provides enough statistics for a reliable rate calculation. There is a strong Malmquist bias, so the average size (luminosity or mass) of the galaxies increases monotonically with distance, and this trend is used to showcase a correlation between SN rates and galaxy sizes. Very few core-collapse SNe are found in early-type galaxies, providing strong constraints on the amount of recent star formation within these galaxies. The small average observation interval (˜9 d) of our survey ensures that our control-time calculations can tolerate a reasonable amount of uncertainty in the luminosity functions of SNe. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to determine the limiting magnitude of each image and the SN detection efficiency as a function of galaxy Hubble type. The limiting magnitude and the detection efficiency, together with the luminosity function derived from a complete sample of very nearby SNe in Paper II, will be used to calculate the control time and the SN rates in Paper III.},

Within the substantial uncertainties, the estimates are shown to be quite comparable and give a galactic rate of 10-6 to 10-5 yr-1 for both events. These rates are several orders of magnitude lower than the rate of core-collapse supernovae, suggesting that the evolution leading to an HN/GRB requires special circumstances, very likely due to binary interactions. Various possible binary channels are discussed, and it is shown that these are generally compatible with the inferred rates.},

abstract = {SN 1998bw and its corresponding relativistically expanding radio source are coincident with the gamma -ray burst source GRB 980425. We searched for other possible supernova- gamma -ray burst associations among 101 recent Type Ia and 17 Type Ib/c supernovae (SNe) for which the dates of optical maximum are relatively well known. We show that Type Ia SNe can be excluded as the source of gamma -ray bursts (GRBs) at a high significance level (greater than 4 sigma ) and that the current data are consistent with Type Ib/c SNe as GRB producers. If the Type Ib/c event SN 1998bw does not represent a special class of GRBs, but is representative of the general mechanism for GRBs, it would imply GRB energies that are some fraction of an SN energy. This in turn demands strong collimation into perhaps 10-3 sr to explain GRBs at higher redshifts. Such collimation requires a high rate of occurrence, perhaps consistent with an SN rate. The collimated flow may be generated by core collapse to produce rotating, magnetized neutron stars. Having lost most or all of their hydrogen and helium envelope before explosion, Type Ib/c SNe are particularly amenable to SN-GRB associations. Asymmetries in line profiles and spectropolarimetry of Types II and Ib/c SNe, pulsar runaway velocities, soft gamma -ray repeaters, and GRBs may be associated phenomena.},

abstract = {A systematic survey of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds for radio pulsars using the Parkes radio telescope and the 20 cm multibeam receiver has resulted in the discovery of 14 pulsars and the redetection of five of the eight previously known spin-powered pulsars believed to lie in the Magellanic Clouds. Of the 14 new discoveries, 12 are believed to lie within Clouds, three in the Small Cloud and nine in the Large Cloud, bringing the total number of known spin-powered pulsars in the Clouds to 20. Averaged over all positions within the survey area, the survey had a limiting flux density of about 0.12 mJy. Observed dispersion measures suggest that the mean free electron density in the Magellanic Clouds is similar to that in the disk of our Galaxy. The observed radio luminosities have little or no dependence on pulsar period or characteristic age and the differential luminosity function is consistent with a power-law slope of -1, as is observed for Galactic pulsars.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an assortment of both standard and advanced Fourier techniques that are useful in the analysis of astrophysical time series of very long duration -- where the observation time is much greater than the time resolution of the individual data points. We begin by reviewing the operational characteristics of Fourier transforms (FTs) of time series data, including power spectral statistics, discussing some of the differences between analyses of binned data, sampled data, and event data, and briefly discuss algorithms for calculating discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) of very long time series. We then discuss the response of DFTs to periodic signals, and present techniques to recover Fourier amplitude "lost" during simple traditional analyses if the periodicities change frequency during the observation. These techniques include Fourier interpolation which allows us to correct the response for signals that occur between Fourier frequency bins. We then present techniques for estimating additional signal properties such as the signal's centroid and duration in time, the first and second derivatives of the frequency, the pulsed fraction, and an overall estimate of the significance of a detection. Finally, we present a recipe for a basic but thorough Fourier analysis of a time series for well-behaved pulsations.

abstract = {We describe a new and efficient technique which we call sideband or phase-modulation searching that allows one to detect short period binary pulsars in observations longer than the orbital period. The orbital motion of the pulsar during long observations effectively modulates the phase of the pulsar signal causing sidebands to appear around the pulsar spin frequency and its harmonics in the Fourier transform. For the majority of binary radio pulsars or Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs), large numbers of sidebands are present, allowing efficient searches using Fourier transforms of short portions of the original power spectrum. Analysis of the complex amplitudes and phases of the sidebands can provide enough information to solve for the Keplerian orbital parameters. This technique is particularly applicable to radio pulsar searches in globular clusters and searches for coherent X-ray pulsations from LMXBs and is complementary to more standard ``acceleration'' searches.

abstract = {We report the results of a 944 epoch survey for transient sources with archival data from the Very Large Array spanning 22 years with a typical epoch separation of 7 days. Observations were obtained at 5 or 8.4 GHz for a single field of view and achieved a typical point-source detection threshold at the beam center of 300 $\mu$Jy per epoch. Ten transient sources were detected with a significance threshold such that only one false positive would be expected. Of these transients, eight were detected in only a single epoch. Two transients were too faint to be detected in individual epochs but were detected in 2 month averages. None of the 10 transients was detected in longer term averages or associated with persistent emission in the deep image produced from the combination of all epochs. The cumulative rate for the short-timescale radio transients above 370 $\mu$Jy at 5 and 8.4 GHz is 0.07 deg-2 yr-1<~R<~40 deg-2 yr-1, where the uncertainty is due to the unknown duration of the transients, 20 minutes < tchar < 7 days. A two-epoch survey for transients will detect 1.5+/-0.4 transients per square degree above a flux density of 370 $\mu$Jy. Two transients are associated with galaxies at z=0.040 and z=0.249. These may be similar to the peculiar Type Ib/c radio supernova SN 1998bw associated with GRB 980428. We detect no counterparts for six transients in deep optical and infrared imaging. The hosts and progenitors of these transients are unknown.},

abstract = {Recently, a new class of radio transients in the 5 GHz band and with durations of the order of hours to days, lacking any visible-light counterparts, was detected by Bower and collaborators. We present new deep near-infrared (IR) observations of the field containing these transients, and find no counterparts down to a limiting magnitude of K = 20.4 mag. We argue that the bright (>1 Jy) radio transients recently reported by Kida et al. are consistent with being additional examples of the Bower et al. transients. We refer to these groups of events as "long-duration radio transients." The main characteristics of this population are: timescales longer than 30 minutes but shorter than several days; very large rate, ~103 deg-2 yr-1 progenitor's sky surface density of >60 deg-2 (at 95% confidence) at Galactic latitude ~40$\,^{\circ}$ 1.4-5 GHz spectral slopes, f $\nu$ vprop $\nu$$\alpha$, with $\alpha$ >~ 0; and most notably the lack of any X-ray, visible-light, near-IR, and radio counterparts in quiescence. We discuss putative known astrophysical objects that may be related to these transients and rule out an association with many types of objects including supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, quasars, pulsars, and M-dwarf flare stars. Galactic brown dwarfs or some sort of exotic explosions in the intergalactic medium remain plausible (though speculative) options. We argue that an attractive progenitor candidate for these radio transients is the class of Galactic isolated old neutron stars (NSs). We confront this hypothesis with Monte Carlo simulations of the space distribution of old NSs, and find satisfactory agreement for the large areal density. Furthermore, the lack of quiescent counterparts is explained quite naturally. In this framework, we find: the mean distance to events in the Bower et al. sample is of order kpc; the typical distance to the Kida et al. transients are constrained to be between 45 pc and 2 kpc (at the 95% confidence level); these events should repeat with a timescale of order several months; and sub-mJy level bursts should exhibit Galactic latitude dependence. We discuss two possible mechanisms giving rise to the observed radio emission: incoherent synchrotron emission and coherent emission. We speculate that if the latter is correct, the long-duration radio transients are sputtering ancient pulsars or magnetars and will exhibit pulsed emission.},

The formation of a power-law cusp in the stellar density distribution of a globular cluster is analyzed, the rate at which stars in the cusp are swallowed or disrupted by the black hole is estimated, and probable observable manifestations of these processes are considered. It is argued that most stars on orbits with radii less than or approximately equal to some defined 'critical radius' will diffuse into low-angular-momentum 'loss-cone' orbits on a timescale comparable to the stellar relaxation time in the cluster core and will ultimately be swallowed by the black hole. The results are applied to Hills' (1975) model of a galactic nucleus containing a black hole of at least 10 million solar masses.},

A digital signal processing (DSP) community is forming that uses shared hardware development, signal processing libraries, and instrument architectures to reduce development time of digital instrumentation and to improve time-to-science for a wide variety of projects. We suggest prioritizing technological development supporting the needs of this nascent DSP community. After outlining several instrument classes that are relying on digital instrumentation development to achieve new science objectives, we identify key areas where technologies pertaining to interoperability and processing flexibility will reduce the time, risk, and cost of developing the digital instrumentation for radio astronomy. These areas represent focus points where support of general-purpose, open-source development for a DSP community should be prioritized in the next decade. Contributors to such technological development may be centers of support for this DSP community, science groups that contribute general-purpose DSP solutions as part of their own instrumentation needs, or engineering groups engaging in research that may be applied to next-generation DSP instrumentation.},

The data show strong evidence for a Galaxy consisting of an oblate halo, a disk component, and a number of localized overdensities with exponential disk parameters (bias-corrected for an assumed 35% binary fraction) H_1 = 300 pc, L_1 = 2600 pc, H_2 = 900 pc, L_2 = 3600 pc, and local density normalization of 12%. We find the halo to be oblate, with best-fit axis ratio c/a = 0.64, r^{-2.8} profile, and the local halo-to-thin disk normalization of 0.5%. We estimate the errors of derived model parameters to be no larger than ~20% (disk scales) and ~10% (thick disk normalization). While generally consistent with the above model, the density distribution shows a number of statistically significant localized deviations. We detect two overdensities in the thick disk region at (R, Z) ~ (6.5, 1.5)kpc and (R, Z) ~ (9.5, 0.8) kpc, and a remarkable density enhancement in the halo covering >1000deg^2 of sky towards the constellation of Virgo, at distances of ~6-20 kpc. Compared to a region symmetric with respect to the l=0 line, the Virgo overdensity is responsible for a factor of 2 number density excess and may be a nearby tidal stream or a low-surface brightness dwarf galaxy merging with the Milky Way. After removal of the resolved overdensities, the remaining data are consistent with a smooth density distribution; we detect no evidence of further unresolved clumpy substructure at scales ranging from ~50pc in the disk, to ~1 - 2 kpc in the halo.

The technique has already been applied to a small portion of the data from the Parkes multi-beam pulsar survey, resulting in the discovery of four new pulsars, so illustrating its efficacy.},

abstract = {The relatively unexplored fast radio transient parameter space is known to be home to a variety of interesting sources, including pulsars, pulsar giant pulses, and non-thermal emission from planetary magnetospheres. In addition, a variety of hypothesized but as-yet-unobserved phenomena such as primordial black hole evaporation and prompt emission associated with coalescing massive objects have been suggested. The 2007 announcement by Lorimer et al. of the detection of a bright (30 Jy) radio pulse that was inferred to be of extragalactic origin and the subsequent consternation have demonstrated both the need for wide-field surveys characterizing the fast-transient parameter space and the potential utility of bright radio pulses as probes of the interstellar medium and intergalactic medium. Here we present results from the 450 hr, 150 deg2 Fly's Eye survey for bright dispersed radio pulses at the Allen Telescope Array (ATA). The Fly's Eye Spectrometer produces 128 channel power spectra over a 209 MHz bandwidth, centered at 1430 MHz, on 44 independent signal paths originating with 30 independent ATA antennae. Data were dedispersed between 0 and 2000 pc cm-3 and searched for pulses with dispersion measures greater than 50 pc cm-3 between 625 $\mu$s and 5 s in duration. No pulses were detected in the survey, implying a limiting rate of less than 2 sky-1 hr-1 for 10 ms duration pulses having apparent energy densities greater than 440 kJy $\mu$s, or mean flux densities greater than 44 Jy. Here we present details of the instrument, experiment, and observations, including a discussion of our results in light of other single pulse searches.},

abstract = {Having discovered 885 planet candidates in 361 multiple-planet systems, Kepler has made transits a powerful method for studying the statistics of planetary systems. The orbits of only two pairs of planets in these candidate systems are apparently unstable. This indicates that a high percentage of the candidate systems are truly planets orbiting the same star, motivating physical investigations of the population. Pairs of planets in this sample are typically not in orbital resonances. However, pairs with orbital period ratios within a few percent of a first-order resonance (e.g. 2:1, 3:2) prefer orbital spacings just wide of the resonance and avoid spacings just narrow of the resonance. Finally, we investigate mutual inclinations based on transit duration ratios. We infer that the inner planets of pairs tend to have a smaller impact parameter than their outer companions, suggesting these planetary systems are typically coplanar to within a few degrees.},

Follow-up observations with the Arecibo telescope confirm the binary nature of the system. We obtain a circular orbital solution with an orbital period of 9.4 hr, a projected orbital radius of 2.8 lt-s, and a mass function of f = 0.15 solar masses by analysis of spin period measurements. No evidence of orbital eccentricity is apparent; we set a 2-sigma upper limit e < 1.7e-3. The orbital parameters suggest a massive white dwarf companion with a minimum mass of 0.95 solar masses, assuming a pulsar mass of 1.4 solar masses. Most likely, this pulsar belongs to the rare class of intermediate mass binary pulsars. Future timing observations will aim to determine the parameters of this system further, measure relativistic effects, and elucidate the nature of the companion star.

The fourth and sixth order cumulants of the received signal are used as the input classification feature vector to the SVM. The SVM maps the input vectors nonlinearly into a high dimensional feature space, constructs the optimum separating hyperplane in that space and makes the non-separable data separable. This method is robust to Gaussian noise and constellation rotation due to the initial phase of the signal and avoids the overfitting and local minimum in a neural network. The high performance and robustness of the algorithms are proved by computer simulation. View full abstract},

abstract = {Two-body energy exchange between stars orbiting massive black holes (MBHs) leads to the formation of a power-law density distribution n(r) $\alpha$ r-$\alpha$ that diverges towards the MBH. For a single mass population, $\alpha$ =7/4 and the flow of stars is much less than N(< r)/ tr (enclosed number of stars per relaxation time). This "zero-flow" solution is maintained for a multi-mass system for moderate mass ratios or systems where there are many heavy stars, and slopes of 3/2 < $\alpha$ < 2 are reached, with steeper slopes for the more massive stars. If the heavy stars are rare and massive however, the zero-flow limit breaks down and much steeper distributions are obtained. We discuss the physics driving mass-segregation with the use of Fokker-Planck calculations, and show that steady state is reached in 0.2-0.3 tr. Since the relaxation time in the Galactic centre (GC) is tr˜ 2-3 ×1010 yr, a cusp should form in less than a Hubble time. The absence of a visible cusp of old stars in the GC poses a challenge to these models, suggesting that processes other than two-body relaxation have played a role. We discuss astrophysical processes within the GC that depend crucially on the details of the stellar cusp.},

abstract = {We characterize the star KOI 961, an M dwarf with transit signals indicative of three short-period exoplanets discovered by the Kepler mission. We proceed by comparing KOI 961 to Barnard's Star, a nearby, well-characterized mid-M dwarf. We compare colors, optical and near-infrared spectra, and find remarkable agreement between the two, implying similar effective temperatures and metallicities. Both are metal-poor compared to the Solar neighborhood, have low projected rotational velocity, high absolute radial velocity, large proper motion, and no quiescent H$\alpha$ emission---all of which are consistent with being old M dwarfs. We combine empirical measurements of Barnard's Star and expectations from evolutionary isochrones to estimate KOI 961's mass (0.13 $\pm$ 0.05 M {\&}sun;), radius (0.17 $\pm$ 0.04 R {\&}sun;), and luminosity (2.40 × 10-3.0 $\pm$ 0.3 L {\&}sun;). We calculate KOI 961's distance (38.7 $\pm$ 6.3 pc) and space motions, which, like Barnard's Star, are consistent with a high scale-height population in the Milky Way. We perform an independent multi-transit fit to the public Kepler light curve and significantly revise the transit parameters for the three planets. We calculate the false-positive probability for each planet candidate, and find a less than 1% chance that any one of the transiting signals is due to a background or hierarchical eclipsing binary, validating the planetary nature of the transits. The best-fitting radii for all three planets are less than 1 R ⊕, with KOI 961.03 being Mars-sized (RP = 0.57 $\pm$ 0.18 R ⊕), and they represent some of the smallest exoplanets detected to date.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of nine previously unknown gamma-ray pulsars in a blind search of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). The pulsars were found with a novel hierarchical search method originally developed for detecting continuous gravitational waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars. Designed to find isolated pulsars spinning at up to kHz frequencies, the new method is computationally efficient, and incorporates several advances, including a metric-based gridding of the search parameter space (frequency, frequency derivative and sky location) and the use of photon probability weights. The nine pulsars have spin frequencies between 3 and 12 Hz, and characteristic ages ranging from 17 kyr to 3 Myr. Two of them, PSRs J1803-2149 and J2111+4606, are young and energetic Galactic-plane pulsars (spin-down power above 6e35 erg/s and ages below 100 kyr). The seven remaining pulsars, PSRs J0106+4855, J0622+3749, J1620-4927, J1746-3239, J2028+3332, J2030+4415, J2139+4716, are older and less energetic; two of them are located at higher Galactic latitudes (|b| > 10 deg). PSR J0106+4855 has the largest characteristic age (3 Myr) and the smallest surface magnetic field (2e11 G) of all LAT blind-search pulsars. PSR J2139+4716 has the lowest spin-down power (3e33 erg/s) among all non-recycled gamma-ray pulsars ever found. Despite extensive multi-frequency observations, only PSR J0106+4855 has detectable pulsations in the radio band. The other eight pulsars belong to the increasing population of radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars.

The search has resulted in the discovery of 16 pulsars including a binary millisecond pulsar and an intermittent pulsar. Despite a number of promising candidates there have been no new discoveries of relativistic binary pulsars. Here, we detail the acceleration search performed in our analysis and present coherent timing solutions for each of the pulsars discovered. In light of the lack of discoveries of relativistic binary pulsars, we also discuss the technique of acceleration searching and its effectiveness in finding these systems.},

We then demonstrate a method for combining independent data sets into a single event rate constraint diagram, using a probabilistic approach to the limits on parameter space. We apply this new framework to present the latest results from the V-FASTR experiment, a commensal fast transients search using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). In the 20 cm band, V-FASTR now has the ability to probe the regions of parameter space of importance for the observed Lorimer and Keane fast radio transient candidates by combining the information from observations with differing bandwidths, and properly accounting for the source dispersion measure, VLBA antenna beam shape, experiment time sampling, and stochastic nature of events. We then apply the framework to combine the results of the V-FASTR and Allen Telescope Array Fly's Eye experiments, demonstrating their complementarity. Expectations for fast transients experiments for the SKA Phase I dish array are then computed, and the impact of large differential bandwidths is discussed.},

abstract = {We present the first results from the V-FASTR experiment, a commensal search for fast transient radio bursts using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). V-FASTR is unique in that the widely spaced VLBA antennas provide a discriminant against non-astronomical signals and a mechanism for the localization and identification of events that is not possible with single dishes or short baseline interferometers. Thus, far V-FASTR has accumulated over 1300 hr of observation time with the VLBA, between 90 cm and 3 mm wavelength (327 MHz-86 GHz), providing the first limits on fast transient event rates at high radio frequencies (>1.4 GHz). V-FASTR has blindly detected bright individual pulses from seven known pulsars but has not detected any single-pulse events that would indicate high-redshift impulsive bursts of radio emission. At 1.4 GHz, V-FASTR puts limits on fast transient event rates comparable with the PALFA survey at the Arecibo telescope, but generally at lower sensitivities, and comparable to the "fly's eye" survey at the Allen Telescope Array, but with less sky coverage. We also illustrate the likely performance of the Phase 1 SKA dish array for an incoherent fast transient search fashioned on V-FASTR.},

abstract = {A new generation of observational science instruments is dramatically increasing collected data volumes in a range of fields. These instruments include the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), terrestrial sensor networks, and NASA satellites participating in "decadal survey" missions. Their unprecedented coverage and sensitivity will likely reveal wholly new categories of unexpected and transient events. Commensal methods passively analyze these data streams, recognizing anomalous events of scientific interest and reacting in real time. We report on a case example: V-FASTR, an ongoing commensal experiment at the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) that uses online adaptive pattern recognition to search for anomalous fast radio transients. V-FASTR triages a millisecond-resolution stream of data and promotes candidate anomalies for further offline analysis. It tunes detection parameters in real time, injecting synthetic events to continually retrain itself for optimum performance. This self-tuning approach retains sensitivity to weak signals while adapting to changing instrument configurations and noise conditions. The system has operated since July 2011, making it the longest-running real time commensal radio transient experiment to date.},

abstract = {Recent discoveries of dispersed, non-periodic impulsive radio signals with single-dish radio telescopes have sparked significant interest in exploring the relatively uncharted space of fast transient radio signals. Here we describe V-FASTR, an experiment to perform a blind search for fast transient radio signals using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The experiment runs entirely in a commensal mode, alongside normal VLBA observations and operations. It is made possible by the features and flexibility of the DiFX software correlator that is used to process VLBA data. Using the VLBA for this type of experiment offers significant advantages over single-dish experiments, including a larger field of view, the ability to easily distinguish local radio-frequency interference from real signals, and the possibility to localize detected events on the sky to milliarcsecond accuracy. We describe our software pipeline, which accepts short integration (~ ms) spectrometer data from each antenna in real time during correlation and performs an incoherent dedispersion separately for each antenna, over a range of trial dispersion measures. The dedispersed data are processed by a sophisticated detector and candidate events are recorded. At the end of the correlation, small snippets of the raw data at the time of the events are stored for further analysis. We present the results of our event detection pipeline from some test observations of the pulsars B0329+54 and B0531+21 (the Crab pulsar).},

abstract = {For life-forms like us, the most important feature of Earth is its habitability. Understanding habitability and using that knowledge to locate the nearest habitable planet may be crucial for our survival as a species. During the past decade, expectations that the universe could be filled with habitable planets have been bolstered by the increasingly large overlap between terrestrial environments known to harbor life and the variety of environments on newly detected rocky exoplanets. The inhabited and uninhabited regions on Earth tell us that temperature and the presence of water are the main constraints that can be used in a habitability classification scheme for rocky planets. Our compilation and review of recent exoplanet detections suggests that the fraction of stars with planets is ˜100%, and that the fraction with rocky planets may be comparably large. We review extensions to the circumstellar habitable zone (HZ), including an abiogenesis habitable zone and the galactic habitable zone.},

abstract = {Searches for transient astrophysical sources often reveal unexpected classes of objects that are useful physical laboratories. In a recent survey for pulsars and fast transients we have uncovered four millisecond-duration radio transients all more than 40{\deg} from the Galactic plane. The bursts' properties indicate that they are of celestial rather than terrestrial origin. Host galaxy and intergalactic medium models suggest that they have cosmological redshifts of 0.5 to 1, and distances of up to 3 gigaparsecs. No temporally coincident x- or gamma-ray signature was identified in association with the bursts. Characterization of the source population and identification of host galaxies offers an opportunity to determine the baryonic content of the Universe.

For each star at least 4 MHz of bandwidth surrounding the 21-cm HI line and/or the 18-cm OH lines was studied with a spectral resolution of 5.5 Hz in both right and left circular polarization. The formal limit of sensitivity achieved during the course of this search varied depending upon the particular receivers available. In all cases the search could have detected a narrow band transmitter of power comparable to the Arecibo planetary radar, had any such been transmitting on the frequencies searched during the time of observation out to the distance of the farthest target star. As in previous searches, the number of "false alarms" encountered was far greater than predicted on the basis of Gaussian noise statistics. A small number of stars have exhibited signals which cannot immediately be explained in terms of astrophysical or man-made sources and deserve re-observation. This is typical of the results of previous non-real-time searches and does not yet constitute the detection of an ETI.},

With these two telescopes, we conducted a targeted search of nearly two hundred solar-type stars covering the frequency range from 1.2-3 GHz. The signal detection system described in the paper by Dreher [1]was optimized to detect narrowband signals (presumed to be transmitted by another technological civilization) originating in the vicinity of these targets. The system was sensitive to signals that were continuously present, or pulsed regularly, even if their frequencies drifted, or changed slowly in time. Many signals of precisely this nature were detected---coming from our own technology! All manner of transmitters, from microwave ovens to satellite downlinks, are rapidly making this naturally quiet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum extremely noisy. The use of the two widely separated telescopes as a pseudo-interferometer was essential to discriminate against signals of terrestrial origin. The performance of the system and the results of the observing campaign are presented in this paper, while the cooperative science observations that were undertaken with Australian PIs are described in a companion paper.},

SERENDIP looked at 95% of the sky visible from Arecibo in the 424-436 MHz range, analyzed 10 14 spectral bins, and logged information on over 2.5×10 8 signals. The fourth generation SERENDIP system expands on the SERENDIP III design. SERENDIP IV computes 2×10 11 operations each second, providing spectral analysis on 160 million channels in 1.7 s. We will discuss the design and use of the SERENDIP IV system and future observing plans.},

abstract = {Future international collaborations could lead to a new generation of radio telescopes with 10-100 times the performance of the most powerful telescopes existing today. There is already a demand for this from both radioastronomy and SETI communities. The scientific arguments are in place and they are very similar for both disciplines. URSI and IAU Working Groups have been set up recently to consider the problems. Development and construction could be achieved by 2005. The collecting area being considered is of the order of a square kilometre. This area would be spread over tens of kilometres to give a suitable high resolution. The preferred frequency range is from 200 to 5000 MHz. Construction cost would probably be of the order of a few $100 m. This proposal will be discussed in the context of the need for exponential growth (Livingston curves) for major scientific disciplines to survive. The growth is fed by a series of technological advances. This next generation telescope will undoubtedly require the development of new and innovative technologies in areas such as antennas, amplifiers, interference control, signal transport and data processing.},

It has been shown that if extraterrestrial intelligences (ETIs) communicate using similar technology, then the SKA should be able to detect such transmissions up to distances of ~100 pc (~300 light years) from Earth. However, Mankind has greatly improved its communications technology over the last century, dramatically reducing signal leakage and making the Earth `radio quiet'. If ETIs follow the same pattern as the human race, will we be able to detect their signal leakage before they become radio quiet? We investigate this question using Monte Carlo realization techniques to simulate the growth and evolution of intelligent life in the Galaxy. We show that if civilizations are `human' in nature (i.e. they are only `radio loud' for ~100 years, and can only detect each other with an SKA-like instrument out to 100 pc, within a maximum communication time of 100 years), then the probability for such civilizations accidentally detecting each other is low (~10-7), much lower than if other, dedicated communication techniques are permissible (e.g. optical SETI or neutrino communication).},

abstract = {A one-dimensional climate model is used to estimate the width of the habitable zone (HZ) around our Sun and around other main sequence stars. Our basic premise is that we are dealing with Earth-like planets with CO2/H2O/N2 atmospheres and that habitability requires the presence of liquid water on the planet's surface. The inner edge of the HZ is determined in our model by loss of water via photolysis and hydrogen escape. The outer edge of the HZ is determined by the formation of CO2 clouds, which cool a planet's surface by increasing its albedo and by lowering the convective lapse rate. Conservative estimates for these distances in our own Solar System are 0.95 and 1.37 AU, respectively; the actual width of the present HZ could be much greater. Between these two limits, climate stability is ensured by a feedback mechanism in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations vary inversely with planetary surface temperature. The width of the HZ is slightly greater for planets that are larger than Earth and for planets which have higher N2 partial pressures. The HZ evolves outward in time because the Sun increases in luminosity as it ages. A conservative estimate for the width of the 4.6-Gyr continuously habitable zone (CHZ) is 0.95 to 1.15 AU. Stars later than F0 have main sequence lifetimes exceeding 2 Gyr and, so, are also potential candidates for harboring habitable planets. The HZ around an F star is larger and occurs farther out than for our Sun; the HZ around K and M stars is smaller and occurs farther in. Nevertheless, the widths of all of these HZs are approximately the same if distance is expressed on a logarithmic scale. A log distance scale is probably the appropriate scale for this problem because the planets in our own Solar System are spaced logarithmically and because the distance at which another star would be expected to form planets should be related to the star's mass. The width of the CHZ around other stars depends on the time that a planet is required to remain habitable and on whether a planet that is initially frozen can be thawed by modest increases in stellar luminosity. For a specified period of habitability, CHZs around K and M stars are wider (in log distance) than for our Sun because these stars evolve more slowly. Planets orbiting late K stars and M stars may not be habitable, however, because they can become trapped in synchronous rotation as a consequence of tidal damping. F stars have narrower (log distance) CHZ's than our Sun because they evolve more rapidly. Our results suggest that mid-to-early K stars should be considered along with G stars as optimal candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life.},

abstract = {Of the over 150 different molecular species detected in the interstellar and circumstellar media, approximately 50 contain 6 or more atoms. These molecules, labeled complex by astronomers if not by chemists, all contain the element carbon and so can be called organic. In the interstellar medium, complex molecules are detected in the denser sources only. Although, with one exception, complex molecules have only been detected in the gas phase, there is strong evidence that they can be formed in ice mantles on interstellar grains. The nature of the gaseous complex species depends dramatically on the source where they are found: in cold, dense regions they tend to be unsaturated (hydrogen-poor) and exotic, whereas in young stellar objects, they tend to be quite saturated (hydrogen-rich) and terrestrial in nature. Based on both their spectra and chemistry, complex molecules are excellent probes of the physical conditions and history of the sources where they reside. Because they are detected in young stellar objects, complex molecules are expected to be common ingredients for new planetary systems. In this review, we discuss both the observation and chemistry of complex molecules in assorted interstellar regions in the Milky Way.},

The Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared on board the Herschel Space Observatory has detected emission lines from both spin isomers of cold water vapor from the disk around the young star TW Hydrae. This water vapor likely originates from ice-coated solids near the disk surface, hinting at a water ice reservoir equivalent to several thousand Earth oceans in mass. The water's ortho-to-para ratio falls well below that of solar system comets, suggesting that comets contain heterogeneous ice mixtures collected across the entire solar nebula during the early stages of planetary birth.},

abstract = {Using the Fourier Transform Spectrometer at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we observed a spectrum of Mars at the P-branch of the strongest CH 4 band at 3.3 $\mu$m with resolving power of 180,000 for the apodized spectrum. Summing up the spectral intervals at the expected positions of the 15 strongest Doppler-shifted martian lines, we detected the absorption by martian methane at a 3.7 sigma level which is exactly centered in the summed spectrum. The observed CH 4 mixing ratio is 10$\pm$3 ppb. Total photochemical loss of CH 4 in the martian atmosphere is equal to 2.2×10 cms, the CH 4 lifetime is 340 years and methane should be uniformly mixed in the atmosphere. Heterogeneous loss of atmospheric methane is probably negligible, while the sink of CH 4 during its diffusion through the regolith may be significant. There are no processes of CH 4 formation in the atmosphere, so the photochemical loss must therefore be balanced by abiogenic and biogenic sources. Outgassing from Mars is weak, the latest volcanism is at least 10 million years old, and thermal emission imaging from the Mars Odyssey orbiter does not reveal any hot spots on Mars. Hydrothermal systems can hardly be warmer than the room temperature at which production of methane is very low in terrestrial waters. Therefore a significant production of hydrothermal and magmatic methane is not very likely on Mars. The calculated average production of CH 4 by cometary impacts is 2% of the methane loss. Production of methane by meteorites and interplanetary dust does not exceed 4% of the methane loss. Methane cannot originate from an extinct biosphere, as in the case of "natural gas" on Earth, given the exceedingly low limits on organic matter set by the Viking landers and the dry recent history which has been extremely hostile to the macroscopic life needed to generate the gas. Therefore, methanogenesis by living subterranean organisms is a plausible explanation for this discovery. Our estimates of the biomass and its production using the measured CH 4 abundance show that the martian biota may be extremely scarce and Mars may be generally sterile except for some oases.},

abstract = {We observed the Crab pulsar with the 43-m telescope in Green Bank, WV over a timespan of 15 months. In total we obtained 100 hours of data at 1.2 GHz and seven hours at 330 MHz, resulting in a sample of about 95000 giant pulses (GPs). This is the largest sample, to date, of GPs from the Crab pulsar taken with the same telescope and backend and analyzed as one data set. We calculated power-law fits to amplitude distributions for main pulse (MP) and interpulse (IP) GPs, resulting in indices in the range of 2.1-3.1 for MP GPs at 1.2 GHz and in the range of 2.5-3.0 and 2.4-3.1 for MP and IP GPs at 330 MHz. We also correlated the GPs at 1.2 GHz with GPs from the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT), which were obtained simultaneously at a higher frequency (8.9 GHz) over a span of 26 hours. In total, 7933 GPs from the 43-m telescope at 1.2 GHz and 39900 GPs from the GBT were recorded during these contemporaneous observations. At 1.2 GHz, 236 (3%) MP GPs and 23 (5%) IP GPs were detected at 8.9 GHz, both with zero chance probability. Another 15 (4%) low-frequency IP GPs were detected within one spin period of high-frequency IP GPs, with a chance probability of 9%. This indicates that the emission processes at high and low radio frequencies are related, despite significant pulse profile shape differences. The 43-m GPs were also correlated with Fermi gamma-ray photons to see if increased pair production in the magnetosphere is the mechanism responsible for GP emission. A total of 92022 GPs and 393 gamma-ray photons were used in this correlation analysis. No significant correlations were found between GPs and gamma-ray photons. This indicates that increased pair production in the magnetosphere is likely not the dominant cause of GPs. Possible methods of GP production may be increased coherence of synchrotron emission or changes in beaming direction.

abstract = {An international consortium is presently constructing a beamformer for the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile that will be available as a facility instrument. The beamformer will aggregate the entire collecting area of the array into a single, very large aperture. The extraordinary sensitivity of phased ALMA, combined with the extremely fine angular resolution available on baselines to the Northern Hemisphere, will enable transformational new very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations in Bands 6 and 7 (1.3 and 0.8 mm) and provide substantial improvements to existing VLBI arrays in Bands 1 and 3 (7 and 3 mm). The ALMA beamformer will have impact on a variety of scientific topics, including accretion and outflow processes around black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN), tests of general relativity near black holes, jet launch and collimation from AGN and microquasars, pulsar and magnetar emission processes, the chemical history of the universe and the evolution of fundamental constants across cosmic time, maser science, and astrometry.},

abstract = {We present temporal scattering measurements of single pulses and average profiles of PSR J1745-2900, a magnetar recently discovered only 3 arcsec away from Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), from 1.2 to 18.95 GHz using the Effelsberg 100 m Radio Telescope, the Nan{\c c}ay Decimetric Radio Telescope, and the Jodrell Bank Lovell Telescope. Single pulse analysis shows that the integrated pulse profile above 2 GHz is dominated by pulse jitter, while below 2 GHz the pulse profile shape is dominated by scattering. This is the first object in the Galactic center (GC) with both pulse broadening and angular broadening measurements. We measure a pulse broadening time scale at 1 GHz of $\tau$1GHz = 1.3 $\pm$ 0.2 and pulse broadening spectral index of $\alpha$ = -3.8 $\pm$ 0.2, which is several orders of magnitude lower than predicted by the NE2001 model (Cordes {\&} Lazio 2002). If this scattering time scale is representative of the GC as a whole, then previous surveys should have detected many pulsars. The lack of detections implies either our understanding of scattering in the GC is incomplete or there are fewer pulsars in the GC than previously predicted. Given that magnetars are a rare class of radio pulsar, there are likely many canonical and millisecond pulsars in the GC, and not surprisingly, scattering in the GC is spatially complex.},

abstract = {Pulsars orbiting the Galactic center black hole, Sgr A*, would be potential probes of its mass, distance, and spin, and may even be used to test general relativity. Despite predictions of large populations of both ordinary and millisecond pulsars in the Galactic center, none have been detected within 25 pc by deep radio surveys. One explanation has been that hyperstrong temporal scattering prevents pulsar detections, but the recent discovery of radio pulsations from a highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar) within 0.1 pc shows that the temporal scattering is much weaker than predicted. We argue that an intrinsic deficit in the ordinary pulsar population is the most likely reason for the lack of detections to date: a "missing pulsar problem" in the Galactic center. In contrast, we show that the discovery of a single magnetar implies efficient magnetar formation in the region. If the massive stars in the central parsec form magnetars rather than ordinary pulsars, their short lifetimes could explain the missing pulsars. Efficient magnetar formation could be caused by strongly magnetized progenitors, or could be further evidence of a top-heavy initial mass function. Furthermore, current high-frequency surveys should already be able to detect bright millisecond pulsars, given the measured degree of temporal scattering.},

abstract = {Earth's nearest candidate supermassive black hole lies at the centre of the Milky Way. Its electromagnetic emission is thought to be powered by radiatively inefficient accretion of gas from its environment, which is a standard mode of energy supply for most galactic nuclei. X-ray measurements have already resolved a tenuous hot gas component from which the black hole can be fed. The magnetization of the gas, however, which is a crucial parameter determining the structure of the accretion flow, remains unknown. Strong magnetic fields can influence the dynamics of accretion, remove angular momentum from the infalling gas, expel matter through relativistic jets and lead to synchrotron emission such as that previously observed. Here we report multi-frequency radio measurements of a newly discovered pulsar close to the Galactic Centre and show that the pulsar's unusually large Faraday rotation (the rotation of the plane of polarization of the emission in the presence of an external magnetic field) indicates that there is a dynamically important magnetic field near the black hole. If this field is accreted down to the event horizon it provides enough magnetic flux to explain the observed emission--from radio to X-ray wavelengths--from the black hole.},

SMBH population models, however, provide specific predictions for the properties of the gravitational-wave background (GWB) from binary SMBHs in merging galaxies throughout the Universe.

abstract = {We present an analysis of $23~$yr of pulse arrival times for PSR B1259$-$63. The pulsar is in a binary orbit about its approximately $20~M_{\odot}$ companion LS$~$2883. Our best-fitting timing solution has none of the pulse-number ambiguities that have plagued previous attempts to model the binary orbit. We measure significant first and second time derivatives of the projected semimajor axis and longitude of the periastron of the orbit. These variations are found to be consistent with the precession of the orbital plane due to classical spin-orbit coupling. The derived moment of inertia and spin of the companion are consistent with the companion rotating at near-breakup velocity. The system configuration is also consistent with the geometry derived from both the polarisation of the radio emission and the eclipse of the pulsar by the equatorial disc of the companion. We find strong evidence for orbital period decay that can be attributed to mass loss from the companion star. We also measure a significant proper motion that locates the birth of the system in the Centaurus OB1 association. By combining proper motion of the pulsar with radial velocity measurements of the companion, we measure the three-dimensional velocity of the system. This velocity is used to constrain the masses of the stars prior to the supernova explosion and the kick the pulsar received at or immediately after the explosion.},

abstract = {High-sensitivity radio-frequency observations of millisecond pulsars usually show stochastic, broadband, pulse-shape variations intrinsic to the pulsar emission process. These variations induce jitter noise in pulsar timing observations; understanding the properties of this noise is of particular importance for the effort to detect gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays. We assess the short-term profile and timing stability of 22 millisecond pulsars that are part of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array sample by examining intra-observation arrival time variability and single-pulse phenomenology. In 7 of the 22 pulsars, in the band centred at approximately 1400MHz, we find that the brightest observations are limited by intrinsic jitter. We find consistent results, either detections or upper limits, for jitter noise in other frequency bands. PSR J1909-3744 shows the lowest levels of jitter noise, which we estimate to contribute $\sim$10 ns root mean square error to the arrival times for hour-duration observations. Larger levels of jitter noise are found in pulsars with wider pulses and distributions of pulse intensities. The jitter noise in PSR J0437-4715 decorrelates over a bandwidth of $\sim$2 GHz. We show that the uncertainties associated with timing pulsar models can be improved by including physically motivated jitter uncertainties. Pulse-shape variations will limit the timing precision at future, more sensitive, telescopes; it is imperative to account for this noise when designing instrumentation and timing campaigns for these facilities.},

Modern radio telescopes have significant digital signal processing demands that are typically best met using custom processing engines implemented in Field Programmable Gate Arrays. These demands essentially stem from the ever-larger analogue bandwidths that astronomers wish to observe, resulting in large data volumes that need to be processed in real time. We focused on the development of spectrometers for enabling improved pulsar science on the Allen Telescope Array, the Hartebeesthoek Radio Observatory telescope, the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope, and the Parkes Radio Telescope. We also present work that we conducted on the development of real-time pulsar timing instrumentation. All the work described in this thesis was carried out using generic astronomy processing tools and hardware developed by the Center for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research (CASPER) at the University of California, Berkeley. We successfully deployed to several telescopes instruments that were built solely with CASPER technology, which has helped to validate the approach to developing radio astronomy instruments that CASPER advocates.},

abstract = {As part of a survey for radio pulsars with the Parkes 64 m telescope, we have discovered PSR J1622-4950, a pulsar with a 4.3 s rotation period. Follow-up observations show that the pulsar has the highest inferred surface magnetic field of the known radio pulsars (B ~3 × 1014 G), and it exhibits significant timing noise and appears to have an inverted spectrum. Unlike the vast majority of the known pulsar population, PSR J1622-4950 appears to switch off for many hundreds of days and even in its on-state exhibits extreme variability in its flux density. Furthermore, the integrated pulse profile changes shape with epoch. All of these properties are remarkably similar to the only two magnetars previously known to emit radio pulsations. The position of PSR J1622-4950 is coincident with an X-ray source that, unlike the other radio pulsating magnetars, was found to be in quiescence. We conclude that our newly discovered pulsar is a magnetar---the first to be discovered via its radio emission.},

abstract = {We have carried out observations of the newly discovered magnetar in the direction of Sagittarius A* using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in four frequency bands from 4.5 to 20 GHz. Radio pulsations are clearly detected at all frequencies. We measure the pulsar's dispersion measure to be 1650 $\pm$ 50 cm-3 pc, the highest of any of the known pulsars. Once Faraday rotation has been taken into account, the pulse profile is more than 80 per cent linearly polarized at all frequencies and has a small degree (5 per cent) of circular polarization. The rotation measure of -67000 $\pm$ 500 rad m-2 is the largest (in magnitude) ever measured for a pulsar but still a factor of 8 smaller than Sgr A* itself. The combination of the dispersion and rotation measures implies an integrated magnetic field strength of -50 $\mu$G along the line of sight. The flux density appears to have increased by about a factor of 2 between observations made 30 d apart. This object therefore joins the small class of radio emitting magnetars.},

Figures are calculated for the Targeted Search, and for the Sky Survey parts of the MOP, both operating, as currently planned, in the second half of the decade of the 1990s. Only the most powerful terrestrial transmitters are considered, namely, the planetary radar at Arecibo in Puerto Rico, and the ballistic missile early warning systems (BMEWS). In each case the probabilities of detection over the life of the MOP are also calculated. The calculation assumes that we are only in the eavesdropping mode. Transmissions intended to be detected by SETI systems are likely to be much stronger and would of course be found with higher probability to a greater range. Also, it is assumed that the transmitting civilization is at the same level of technological evolution as ours on Earth. This is very improbable. If we were to detect another technological civilization, it would, on statistical grounds, be much older than we are and might well have much more powerful transmitters. Both factors would make detection by the NASA MOP a much more likely outcome.},

We develop a formalism for translating mid-infrared photometry into quantitative upper limits on extraterrestrial energy supplies. We discuss the likely sources of false positives, how dust can and will contaminate our search, and prospects for distinguishing dust from alien waste heat. We argue that galaxy-spanning civilizations may be easier to distinguish from natural sources than circumstellar civilizations (i.e., Dyson spheres), although GAIA will significantly improve our capability to identify the latter. We present a zeroth order null result of our search based on the WISE all-sky catalog: we show, for the first time, that Kardashev Type III civilizations (as Kardashev originally defined them) are very rare in the local universe. More sophisticated searches can extend our methodology to smaller waste heat luminosities, and potentially entirely rule out (or detect) both Kardashev Type III civilizations and new physics that allows for unlimited "free" energy generation.},

abstract = {We motivate the {\^G} infrared search for extraterrestrial civilizations with large energy supplies. We discuss some philosophical difficulties of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), and how communication SETI circumvents them. We review "Dysonian SETI," the search for artifacts of alien civilizations, and find that it is highly complementary to traditional communication SETI; the two together might succeed where either one alone has not. We discuss the argument of Hart that spacefaring life in the Milky Way should be either galaxy-spanning or non-existent, and examine a portion of his argument that we call the "monocultural fallacy." We discuss some rebuttals to Hart that invoke sustainability and predict long Galaxy colonization timescales. We find that the maximum Galaxy colonization timescale is actually much shorter than previous work has found (<109 yr), and that many "sustainability" counter-arguments to Hart's thesis suffer from the monocultural fallacy. We extend Hart's argument to alien energy supplies and argue that detectably large energy supplies can plausibly be expected to exist because life has the potential for exponential growth until checked by resources or other limitations, and intelligence implies the ability to overcome such limitations. As such, if Hart's thesis is correct, then searches for large alien civilizations in other galaxies may be fruitful; if it is incorrect, then searches for civilizations within the Milky Way are more likely to succeed than Hart argued. We review some past Dysonian SETI efforts and discuss the promise of new mid-infrared surveys, such as that of WISE.},

abstract = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are one of the most tantalizing mysteries of the radio sky; their progenitors and origins remain unknown and until now no rapid multiwavelength follow-up of an FRB has been possible. New instrumentation has decreased the time between observation and discovery from years to seconds, and enables polarimetry to be performed on FRBs for the first time. We have discovered an FRB (FRB 140514) in real-time on 14 May, 2014 at 17:14:11.06 UTC at the Parkes radio telescope and triggered follow-up at other wavelengths within hours of the event. FRB 140514 was found with a dispersion measure (DM) of 562.7(6) cm$^{-3}$ pc, giving an upper limit on source redshift of $z \lesssim 0.5$. FRB 140514 was found to be 21$\pm$7% (3-$\sigma$) circularly polarized on the leading edge with a 1-$\sigma$ upper limit on linear polarization $<10%$. We conclude that this polarization is intrinsic to the FRB. If there was any intrinsic linear polarization, as might be expected from coherent emission, then it may have been depolarized by Faraday rotation caused by passing through strong magnetic fields and/or high density environments. FRB 140514 was discovered during a campaign to re-observe known FRB fields, and lies close to a previous discovery, FRB 110220; based on the difference in DMs of these bursts and time-on-sky arguments, we attribute the proximity to sampling bias and conclude that they are distinct objects. Follow-up conducted by 12 telescopes observing from X-ray to radio wavelengths was unable to identify a variable multiwavelength counterpart, allowing us to rule out models in which FRBs originate from nearby ($z < 0.3$) supernovae and long duration gamma-ray bursts.},

abstract = {We evaluate the hypothesis that extragalactic radio bursts originate from neutron stars. These could be active pulsars or dormant, slowly spinning objects, but the different population distances for these two classes require correspondingly different contributions to burst dispersion measures from any host or intervening galaxies combined with the intergalactic medium. The large, apparent burst rate $\sim 10^4~$ sky$^{-1}~$ day$^{-1}$ is comparable to the core-collapse supernova rate in a Hubble volume and can be accommodated by a single burst per object in the resulting large reservoir of $\sim 10^{17}~$ neutron stars. A smaller population distance requires more bursts per object but the likelihood of seeing repeated bursts from any single object is extremely low on human timescales. Gravitational microlensing could play a role for high redshift sources. Extrapolation of the Crab pulsar's giant pulses --- exemplars of coherent, high brightness temperature radiation --- to a rate of one per $10^3~$yr yields an amplitude detectable out to $\sim 0.3~$ Gpc. Objects with spindown energy loss rates $\dot E$ up to $10^6~$ times larger could be seen even further if allowed by coherent radiation physics. While ample energy is available in neutron-star magnetospheres, the coherent-radiation process must convert particle energies with high efficiency to produce individual, coherent shot pulses. Detailed requirements depend significantly on how coherent shot pulses with unit time bandwidth product are incoherently summed to form millisecond-duration bursts with large time-bandwidth products. For plausible incoherent summing, the largest shot pulse seen from the Crab pulsar is similar in amplitude to those needed for extragalactic bursts. We briefly discuss triggering of neutron-star magnetospheres by internal or external agents.},

The dispersion measure of the burst is 779 cm--3 pc, exceeding predictions for the maximum line-of-sight Galactic contribution by a factor of 11. The temporal structure of the burst is characterized by an exponential scattering tail with a timescale of 2.0+0.8-0.5 ms at 1582 MHz that scales as frequency to the power --4.4+1.6-1.8 (all uncertainties represent 95% confidence intervals). We bound the intrinsic pulse width to be <0.64 ms due to dispersion smearing across a single spectrometer channel. Searches in 78 hr of follow-up observations with the Parkes telescope reveal no additional sporadic emission and no evidence for associated periodic radio emission. We hypothesize that the burst is associated with the Carina dwarf galaxy. Follow-up observations at other wavelengths are necessary to test this hypothesis.},

In addition to our well known SETI@home (Korpela 2011) and Astropulse (Von Korff et al. 2013) public participation SETI survey projects, we have performed several targeted obsevations of different object classes. These include 1) Observations between 1.1 and 1.9 GHz of planetary systems idenfied by Kepler as containing earthlike planets in or near the habitable zones. (Siemion et al. 2013) 2) Wide-band Arecibo observations of 112 sky locations where the Astropulse project has identified strong µs duration dispersed radio pulses. 3) Observations of Kepler identified planetary systems at times when two planets would appear to be in conjuction when viewed from Earth. We plan a future campaign to simultaneously observe known planetary systems at radio, optical and IR wavelengths. We have also continued to advance our instrumentation. We are currently building the sixth generation of our SERENDIP (Siemion et al. 2011, Korpela et al. 2011) series of SETI instrumentation for installation at both Arecibo and GBT. SERENDIP VI will utilize an FPGA based polyphase filter bank course spectrometer feeding 8 or more GPU based compute nodes. The Arecibo version of this spectrometer will be capable of providing thresholded 1Hz resolution spectra of all seven beams of the 320 MHz bandwidth Arecibo L-band Feed Array in dual polarization. A separate front end will be available to allow up to 2.2 GHz of bandwidth in dual polarization from single pixel receivers. The Green Bank version of this spectrometer will utilize the single pixel front end. We are invesitating the possibility of simultaneous back end stages operating on the same or minimal processed data, for example, we could support simulataneous detection of fast extragalactic radio bursts (Thornton et al. 2013) by adding additional compute nodes. We are also developing new instruments that extend our past optical SETI efforts into the infrared. And, of course, our SETI@home and Astropulse projects continue to progress with the addition of new algorithms, porting to new devices including smart phones, and the promise of new data sources.},

abstract = {A new generation of low-frequency radio telescopes is seeking to observe the redshifted 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization (EoR), requiring innovative methods of calibration and imaging to overcome the difficulties of wide-field low-frequency radio interferometry. Precise calibration will be required to separate the expected small EoR signal from the strong foreground emission at the frequencies of interest between 80 and 300 MHz. The Moon may be useful as a calibration source for detection of the EoR signature, as it should have a smooth and predictable thermal spectrum across the frequency band of interest. Initial observations of the Moon with the Murchison Widefield Array 32 tile prototype show that the Moon does exhibit a similar trend to that expected for a cool thermally emitting body in the observed frequency range, but that the spectrum is corrupted by reflected radio emission from Earth. In particular, there is an abrupt increase in the observed flux density of the Moon within the internationally recognized frequency modulated (FM) radio band. The observations have implications for future low-frequency surveys and EoR detection experiments that will need to take this reflected emission from the Moon into account. The results also allow us to estimate the equivalent isotropic power emitted by the Earth in the FM band and to determine how bright the Earth might appear at meter wavelengths to an observer beyond our own solar system.},

Below about 5 GHz the mean profile is dominated by the bright Main Pulse and Low-Frequency Interpulse. Everything changes, however, above about 5 GHz; the Main Pulse disappears, the mean profile of the Crab pulsar is dominated by the High-Frequency Interpulse (which is quite different from its low-frequency counterpart) and the two High-Frequency Components. We present detailed observational characteristics of these different components which future models of the pulsar's magnetosphere must explain.},

For most lines of sight through the Galaxy, spectral broadening due to scattering below about 0.1 Hz at 1 GHz occurs. Spectral broadening is therefore unimportant for the detection of hypothesized signals from extraterrestrial intelligence. Intensity scintillations, however, are of considerable importance. They both help and hinder detection: signals too weak to be detected without the scattering medium may be modulated above the detection threshold while, conversely, signals above threshold can be modulated below. In strong scattering (distances above about 100 pc at 1 GHz), multiple observations of a given target comprise a strategy that is superior to single observations even when the total time per target is held fixed. Decoding information carrying signals may encounter difficulties due to intensity scintillations.},

GAIA will provide positional and radial velocity measurements with the accuracies needed to produce a stereoscopic and kinematic census of about one billion stars throughout our Galaxy (and into the Local Group), amounting to about 1 per cent of the Galactic stellar population. GAIA's main scientific goal is to clarify the origin and history of our Galaxy, from a quantitative census of the stellar populations. It will advance questions such as when the stars in our Galaxy formed, when and how it was assembled, and its distribution of dark matter. The survey aims for completeness to V=20 mag, with accuracies of about 10 microarcsec at 15 mag. Combined with astrophysical information for each star, provided by on-board multi-colour photometry and (limited) spectroscopy, these data will have the precision necessary to quantify the early formation, and subsequent dynamical, chemical and star formation evolution of our Galaxy. Additional products include detection and orbital classification of tens of thousands of extra-Solar planetary systems, and a comprehensive survey of some 10^5-10^6 minor bodies in our Solar System, through galaxies in the nearby Universe, to some 500,000 distant quasars. It will provide a number of stringent new tests of general relativity and cosmology. The complete satellite system was evaluated as part of a detailed technology study, including a detailed payload design, corresponding accuracy assesments, and results from a prototype data reduction development.

abstract = {New transiting planet candidates are identified in sixteen months (May 2009 - September 2010) of data from the Kepler spacecraft. Nearly five thousand periodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumental false positives yielding 1,091 viable new planet candidates, bringing the total count up to over 2,300. Improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing to higher catalog reliability. Most notable is the noise-weighted robust averaging of multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysis which identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. Twenty-two months of photometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the new candidates. Ephemerides (transit epoch, T_0, and orbital period, P) are tabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius (Rp/R*), reduced semi-major axis (d/R*), and impact parameter (b). The largest fractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (197% for candidates smaller than 2Re compared to 52% for candidates larger than 2Re) and those at longer orbital periods (123% for candidates outside of 50-day orbits versus 85% for candidates inside of 50-day orbits). The gains are larger than expected from increasing the observing window from thirteen months (Quarter 1-- Quarter 5) to sixteen months (Quarter 1 -- Quarter 6). This demonstrates the benefit of continued development of pipeline analysis software. The fraction of all host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17% to 20%, and the paucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. The progression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each new catalog release suggests that Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone are forthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.},

abstract = {We analyze the statistics of Doppler-detected planets and Keplere-detected planet candidates of high integrity. We determine the number of planets per star as a function of planet mass, radius, and orbital period, and the occurrence of planets as a function of stellar mass. We consider only orbital periods less than 50 days around Solar-type (GK) stars, for which both Doppler and Kepler offer good completeness. We account for observational detection effects to determine the actual number of planets per star. From Doppler-detected planets discovered in a survey of 166 nearby G and K main sequence stars we find a planet occurrence of 15+5-4% for planets with M sin i = 3-30 ME and P < 50 d, as described in Howard et al. (2010). From Keplere, the planet occurrence is 0.130 +/- 0.008, 0.023 +/- 0.003, and 0.013 +/- 0.002 planets per star for planets with radii 2-4, 4-8, and 8-32 RE, consistent with Doppler-detected planets. From Keplere, the number of planets per star as a function of planet radius is given by a power law, df/dlog R = kR R$\alpha$ with kR = 2.9+0.5-0.4, $\alpha$ = -1.92 +/- 0.11, and R = RP/RE. Neither the Doppler-detected planets nor the Keplere-detected planets exhibit a ``desert'' at super-Earth and Neptune sizes for close-in orbits, as suggested by some planet population synthesis models. The distribution of planets with orbital period, P, shows a gentle increase in occurrence with orbital period in the range 2-50 d. The occurrence of small, 2-4 RE planets increases with decreasing stellar mass, with seven times more planets around low mass dwarfs (3600-4100 K) than around massive stars (6600-7100 K).},

abstract = {We used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to image one primary beam area at 3 GHz with 8 arcsec FWHM resolution and 1.0 microJy/beam rms noise near the pointing center. The P(D) distribution from the central 10 arcmin of this confusion-limited image constrains the count of discrete sources in the 1 < S(microJy/beam) < 10 range. At this level the brightness-weighted differential count S^2 n(S) is converging rapidly, as predicted by evolutionary models in which the faintest radio sources are star-forming galaxies; and ~96$% of the background originating in galaxies has been resolved into discrete sources. About 63% of the radio background is produced by AGNs, and the remaining 37% comes from star-forming galaxies that obey the far-infrared (FIR) / radio correlation and account for most of the FIR background at lambda = 160 microns. Our new data confirm that radio sources powered by AGNs and star formation evolve at about the same rate, a result consistent with AGN feedback and the rough correlation of black hole and bulge stellar masses. The confusion at centimeter wavelengths is low enough that neither the planned SKA nor its pathfinder ASKAP EMU survey should be confusion limited, and the ultimate source detection limit imposed by "natural" confusion is < 0.01 microJy at 1.4 GHz. If discrete sources dominate the bright extragalactic background reported by ARCADE2 at 3.3 GHz, they cannot be located in or near galaxies and most are < 0.03 microJy at 1.4 GHz.},

We report the occurrence rate of close-in planets (with orbital periods less than 50 days), based on precise Doppler measurements of 166 Sun-like stars. We measured increasing planet occurrence with decreasing planet mass (M). Extrapolation of a power-law mass distribution fitted to our measurements, df/dlogM = 0.39 M-0.48, predicts that 23% of stars harbor a close-in Earth-mass planet (ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 Earth masses). Theoretical models of planet formation predict a deficit of planets in the domain from 5 to 30 Earth masses and with orbital periods less than 50 days. This region of parameter space is in fact well populated, implying that such models need substantial revision.},

abstract = {We analyze 8 years of precise radial velocity measurements from the Keck Planet Search, characterizing the detection threshold, selection effects, and completeness of the survey. We first carry out a systematic search for planets, by assessing the false-alarm probability associated with Keplerian orbit fits to the data. This allows us to understand the detection threshold for each star in terms of the number and time baseline of the observations, and the underlying "noise" from measurement errors, intrinsic stellar jitter, or additional low-mass planets. We show that all planets with orbital periods P < 2000 days, velocity amplitudes K > 20 m s-1, and eccentricities e ≲ 0.6 have been announced, and we summarize the candidates at lower amplitudes and longer orbital periods. For the remaining stars, we calculate upper limits on the velocity amplitude of a companion. For orbital periods less than the duration of the observations, these are typically 10 m s-1 and increase ∝ P2 for longer periods. We then use the nondetections to derive completeness corrections at low amplitudes and long orbital periods and discuss the resulting distribution of minimum mass and orbital period. We give the fraction of stars with a planet as a function of minimum mass and orbital period and extrapolate to long-period orbits and low planet masses. A power-law fit for planet masses >0.3 MJ and periods < 2000 days gives a mass-period distribution dN = CM$\alpha$P$\beta$d ln Md ln P with $\alpha$ = -0.31 $\pm$ 0.2, $\beta$ = 0.26 $\pm$ 0.1, and the normalization constant C such that 10.5% of solar type stars have a planet with mass in the range 0.3--10 MJ and orbital period 2--2000 days. The orbital period distribution shows an increase in the planet fraction by a factor of ≈5 for orbital periods ≳ 300 days. Extrapolation gives 17%--20% of stars having gas giant planets within 20 AU. Finally, we constrain the occurrence rate of planets orbiting M dwarfs compared to FGK dwarfs, taking into account differences in detectability.},

abstract = {The Class A stellar engine (also known as a Shkadov thruster) is a spherical arc mirror, designed to use the impulse from a star's radiation pressure to generate a thrust force, perturbing the star's motion. If this mirror obstructs part of the stellar disc during the transit of an exoplanet, then this may be detected by studying the shape of the transit light curve, presenting another potential means by which the action of extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) can be discerned. We model the light curves produced by exoplanets transiting a star which possesses a Shkadov thruster, and show how the parameters of the planet and the properties of the thruster can be disentangled. provided that radial velocity follow-up measurements are possible, and that other obscuring phenomena typical to exoplanet transit curves (such as the presence of starspots or intrinsic stellar noise) do not dominate. These difficulties aside, we estimate the a priori probability of detecting a Shkadov thruster during an exoplanet transit, which even given optimistic assumptions remains stubbornly low. Despite this, many exoplanet transit surveys designed for radial velocity follow-up are on the horizon, so we argue that this remains a useful serendipitous SETI technique. At worst, this technique will place an upper limit on the number of Class A stellar engines in the Solar neighbourhood; at best, this could help identify unusual transiting exoplanet systems as candidates for further investigation with other SETI methods.},

abstract = {Many physically motivated extensions to general relativity (GR) predict significant deviations in the properties of spacetime surrounding massive neutron stars. We report the measurement of a 2.01 +/- 0.04 solar mass pulsar in a 2.46-hr orbit with a 0.172 +/- 0.003 solar mass white dwarf. The high pulsar mass and the compact orbit make this system a sensitive laboratory of a previously untested strong-field gravity regime. Thus far, the observed orbital decay agrees with GR, supporting its validity even for the extreme conditions present in the system. The resulting constraints on deviations support the use of GR-based templates for ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Additionally, the system strengthens recent constraints on the properties of dense matter and provides insight to binary stellar astrophysics and pulsar recycling.

abstract = {LOFAR, the LOw-Frequency ARray, is a new-generation radio interferometer constructed in the north of the Netherlands and across europe. Utilizing a novel phased-array design, LOFAR covers the largely unexplored low-frequency range from 10-240 MHz and provides a number of unique observing capabilities. Spreading out from a core located near the village of Exloo in the northeast of the Netherlands, a total of 40 LOFAR stations are nearing completion. A further five stations have been deployed throughout Germany, and one station has been built in each of France, Sweden, and the UK. Digital beam-forming techniques make the LOFAR system agile and allow for rapid repointing of the telescope as well as the potential for multiple simultaneous observations. With its dense core array and long interferometric baselines, LOFAR achieves unparalleled sensitivity and angular resolution in the low-frequency radio regime. The LOFAR facilities are jointly operated by the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) foundation, as an observatory open to the global astronomical community. LOFAR is one of the first radio observatories to feature automated processing pipelines to deliver fully calibrated science products to its user community. LOFAR's new capabilities, techniques and modus operandi make it an important pathfinder for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We give an overview of the LOFAR instrument, its major hardware and software components, and the core science objectives that have driven its design. In addition, we present a selection of new results from the commissioning phase of this new radio observatory.},

abstract = {Millisecond pulsars are thought to be neutron stars that have been spun-up by accretion of matter from a binary companion. Although most are in binary systems, some 30% are solitary, and their origin is therefore mysterious. PSR J1719-1438, a 5.7 ms pulsar, was detected in a recent survey with the Parkes 64m radio telescope. We show that it is in a binary system with an orbital period of 2.2 h. Its companion's mass is near that of Jupiter, but its minimum density of 23 g cm$^{-3}$ suggests that it may be an ultra-low mass carbon white dwarf. This system may thus have once been an Ultra Compact Low-Mass X-ray Binary, where the companion narrowly avoided complete destruction.},

abstract = {We measure the proper motion of the pulsar PSR J1745-2900 relative to the Galactic center massive black hole, Sgr A*, using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The pulsar has a transverse velocity of 236 $\pm$ 11 km s-1 at position angle 22 $\pm$ 2 deg east of north at a projected separation of 0.097 pc from Sgr A*. Given the unknown radial velocity, this transverse velocity measurement does not conclusively prove that the pulsar is bound to Sgr A* however, the probability of chance alignment is very small. We do show that the velocity and position are consistent with a bound orbit originating in the clockwise disk of massive stars orbiting Sgr A* and a natal velocity kick of <~ 500 km s-1. An origin among the isotropic stellar cluster is possible but less probable. If the pulsar remains radio-bright, multiyear astrometry of PSR J1745-2900 can detect its acceleration and determine the full three-dimensional orbit. We also demonstrate that PSR J1745-2900 exhibits the same angular broadening as Sgr A* over a wavelength range of 3.6 cm to 0.7 cm, further confirming that the two sources share the same interstellar scattering properties. Finally, we place the first limits on the presence of a wavelength-dependent shift in the position of Sgr A*, i.e., the core shift, one of the expected properties of optically thick jet emission. Our results for PSR J1745-2900 support the hypothesis that Galactic center pulsars will originate from the stellar disk and deepen the mystery regarding the small number of detected Galactic center pulsars.},

No eclipses are observed. We infer that the unseen companion is a compact object with mass comparable to that of the pulsar. In addition to the obvious potential for determining the masses of the pulsar and its companion, this discovery makes feasible a number of studies involving the physics of compact objects, the astrophysics of close binary systems, and special- and general-relativistic effects.},

abstract = {We present the first pulsar parallaxes measured with phase-referenced pulsar VLBI observations at 5 GHz. Because of the steep spectra of pulsars, previous astrometric measurements have been at lower frequencies. However, the strongest pulsars can be observed at 5 GHz, offering the benefit of lower combined ionospheric and tropospheric phase errors, which usually limit VLBI astrometric accuracy. The pulsars B0329+54, B0355+54, and B1929+10 were observed for seven epochs spread evenly over 2 years. For B0329+54, large systematic errors led to only an upper limit on the parallax ($\pi$ < 1.5 mas). A new proper motion and parallax were measured for B0355+54 ($\pi$ = 0.91 $\pm$ 0.16 mas), implying a distance of 1.04 kpc and a transverse velocity of 61 km s-1. The parallax and proper motion for B1929+10 were significantly improved ($\pi$ = 2.77 $\pm$ 0.07 mas), yielding a distance of 361 pc and a transverse velocity of 177 km s-1. We demonstrate that the astrometric errors are correlated with the angular separation between the phase-reference calibrator and the target source, with significantly lower errors at 5 GHz as compared to 1.6 GHz. Finally, based on our new distance determinations for B1929+10 and B0355+54, we derive or constrain the luminosities of each pulsar at high energies. We show that, for thermal emission models, the emitting area for X-rays from PSR B1929+10 is roughly consistent with the canonical size for a heated polar cap and that the conversion of spin-down power to $\gamma$-ray luminosity in B0355+54 must be low. The new proper motion for B1929+10 also implies that its progenitor is unlikely to have been the binary companion of the runaway O star $\zeta$ Ophiuchi.},

abstract = {A Dyson Sphere is a hypothetical construct of a star purposely cloaked by a thick swarm of broken-up planetary material to better utilize all of the stellar energy. A clean Dyson Sphere identification would give a significant signature for intelligence at work. A search for Dyson Spheres has been carried out using the 250,000 source database of the IRAS infrared satellite which covered 96% of the sky. The search has used the Calgary database for the IRAS Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS) to look for fits to blackbody spectra. Searches have been conducted for both pure (fully cloaked) and partial Dyson Spheres in the blackbody temperature region 100 < T < 600 K. When other stellar signatures that resemble a Dyson Sphere are used to eliminate sources that mimic Dyson Spheres very few candidates remain and even these are ambiguous. Upper limits are presented for both pure and partial Dyson Spheres. The sensitivity of the LRS was enough to find Dyson Spheres with the luminosity of the sun out to 300 pc, a reach that encompasses a million solar- type stars.

abstract = {Microwave digital communication at interstellar distances applies to starship and extraterrestrial civilization (SETI and METI) communication. Large distances demand large transmitted power and/or large antennas, while the propagation is transparent over a wide bandwidth. Recognizing a fundamental tradeoff, reduced energy delivered to the receiver at the expense of wide bandwidth (the opposite of terrestrial objectives) is advantageous. Wide bandwidth also results in simpler design and implementation, allowing circumvention of dispersion and scattering arising in the interstellar medium and motion effects and obviating any related processing. The minimum energy delivered to the receiver per bit of information is determined by cosmic microwave background alone. By mapping a single bit onto a carrier burst, the Morse code invented for the telegraph in 1836 comes closer to this minimum energy than approaches used in modern terrestrial radio. Rather than the terrestrial approach of adding phases and amplitudes to increases information capacity while minimizing bandwidth, adding multiple time-frequency locations for carrier bursts increases capacity while minimizing energy per information bit. The resulting location code is extremely simple and yet can approach the minimum energy as bandwidth is expanded. It is consistent with easy discovery, since carrier bursts are energetic and straightforward modifications to post-detection pattern recognition can identify burst patterns.

Specifically, we analyze flux-density statistics of the Vela pulsar at 760 MHz. Because the pulsar exhibits strong diffractive scintillation, these statistics convey information about the spatial extent of the radio emission region. We measure both a characteristic size of the emission region and the emission sizes for individual pulses. Our results imply that the radio emission altitude for the Vela pulsar at this frequency is less than 340 km.},

Most searches did not have high sensitivity and it is not surprising that ETI signals were not detected.

abstract = {When an interplanetary spacecraft is in a solar superior conjunction configuration, the received radio signals are degraded by several effects that generally increase in magnitude as the angle between the spacecraft and the Sun (Sun-Earth-Probe or SEP angle) decreases as viewed by a terrestrial tracking station. During periods of quiescent solar activity, phase scintillation and spectral broadening follow well-defined trends as a function of solar impact distance (SEP angle) and link frequency. During active solar periods, the magnitudes of these effects increase above background levels predicted by the quiet period models. Several such events were observed during the solar superior conjunction of the Cassini spacecraft during the peak of solar cycle 23 in May 2000. Pronounced features in the spectral broadening data above the quiet background appear to be associated with Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), and last for extended periods of time ranging from ˜30 min to ˜4 h. These features are coincident with periods of increased activity seen in the region of the spacecraft signal source on coronal white light images, and tend to be related or matched with EIT flare events and possibly long-duration flare events seen in satellite X-ray data. Several such features were captured in the May 2000 Cassini solar conjunction phase scintillation and spectral broadening data at X band (8.4 GHz) and Ka band (32 GHz) radio frequencies, and are presented here. Such characterizations are beneficial in understanding the impact of such events in future interplanetary communication scenarios during solar conjunction periods.},

abstract = {While Pioneer 11 and Galileo are two deep space missions that experienced radio communication disruptions due to space weather, the success of a mission like Solar Probe, whose goal is to fly by the Sun within a few solar radii of its surface, may depend critically on space weather. It is therefore crucial to thoroughly understand how space weather affects radio communications and to identify ways to predict it. In this study, we explain how enhanced small-scale electron density variations in the solar corona represent adverse space weather to radio communications because they give rise to enhancements in radio propagation phenomena such as spectral broadening and fluctuations in intensity and Doppler of the radio signal known as scintillation. The inability of narrowband radio receivers to track the broadened and rapidly fluctuating radio signal leads to disruption in communication and loss of telemetry. Recent advances have been made in understanding enhanced small-scale density variations and their relationship to the Sun, and we show how this makes it possible to use daily observations of unprecedented solar missions like the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) or Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) to diagnose, monitor, and forecast adverse space weather for deep space communications.},

abstract = {We discuss the possible source of a highly dispersed radio transient discovered in the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey (PMPS). The pulse has a dispersion measure of 746 cm-3 pc, a peak flux density of 400 mJy for the observed pulse width of 7.8 ms and a flat spectrum across a 288-MHz band centred on 1374 MHz. The flat spectrum suggests that the pulse did not originate from a pulsar, but is consistent with radio-emitting magnetar spectra. The non-detection of subsequent bursts constrains any possible pulsar period to ≳1 s, and the pulse energy distribution to being much flatter than typical giant pulse emitting pulsars. The burst is also consistent with the radio signal theorized from an annihilating mini black hole. Extrapolating the PMPS detection rate provides a limit of ? on the density of these objects. We investigate the consistency of these two scenarios, plus several other possible solutions, as potential explanations to the origin of the pulse, as well as for another transient with similar properties: the Lorimer burst.},

abstract = {Over the summer of 2007, we obtained 1191 hr of "drift-scan" pulsar search observations with the Green Bank Telescope at a radio frequency of 350 MHz. Here we describe the survey setup, search procedure, and the discovery and follow-up timing of 13 pulsars. Among the new discoveries, one (PSR J1623-0841) was discovered only through its single pulses, two (PSRs J1327-0755 and J1737-0814) are millisecond pulsars, and another (PSR J2222-0137) is a mildly recycled pulsar. PSR J1327-0755 is a 2.7 ms pulsar at a dispersion measure (DM) of 27.9 pc cm-3 in an 8.7 day orbit with a minimum companion mass of 0.22 M ⊙. PSR J1737-0814 is a 4.2 ms pulsar at a DM of 55.3 pc cm-3 in a 79.3 day orbit with a minimum companion mass of 0.06 M ⊙. PSR J2222-0137 is a 32.8 ms pulsar at a very low DM of 3.27 pc cm-3 in a 2.4 day orbit with a minimum companion mass of 1.11 M ⊙. It is most likely a white-dwarf-neutron-star system or an unusual low-eccentricity double neutron star system. Ten other pulsars discovered in this survey are reported in the companion paper Lynch et al.},

We confirm the earlier flux density measurements for a sample of six pulsars, and we are able to place upper flux density limits for another 12 pulsars. We find that all pulsar spectra have a simple form that can be described using only three parameters, one of which is the lifetime of short nano-pulses in the emission region.The study of the transition region from coherent to incoherent emission needs further and more sensitive observations at even higher radio frequencies.},

Observations of eclipses (transits and occultations) provide a bonanza of information that cannot be obtained from radial-velocity data alone, such as the relative dimensions of the planet and its host star, as well as the orientation of the planet's orbit relative to the sky plane and relative to the stellar rotation axis. The wavelength-dependence of the eclipse signal gives clues about the the temperature and composition of the planetary atmosphere. Anomalies in the timing or other properties of the eclipses may betray the presence of additional planets or moons. Searching for eclipses is also a productive means of discovering new planets. This chapter reviews the basic geometry and physics of eclipses, and summarizes the knowledge that has been gained through eclipse observations, as well as the information that might be gained in the future.},

The technology that is being exploited is the construction of many small elements that allow large fields-of-view at high sensitivity, the use of ultra-wideband front-ends, and the use of flexible digital ``intermediate frequency (IF)'' systems. The project is under construction in phases, with the first 32 antennas expected to be functional in the fall of 2004, the next 173 dishes operational early 2006, with plans for 350 antennas total within this decade.},

abstract = {Recent discoveries of highly dispersed millisecond radio bursts by Thornton et al. in a survey with the Parkes radio telescope at 1.4 GHz point towards an emerging population of sources at cosmological distances whose origin is currently unclear. Here we demonstrate that the scattering effects at lower radio frequencies are less than previously thought, and that the bursts could be detectable at redshifts out to about $z=0.5$ in surveys below 1 GHz. Using a source model in which the bursts are standard candles with bolometric luminosities $\sim 8 \times 10^{44}$ ergs/s uniformly distributed per unit comoving volume, we derive an expression for the observed peak flux density as a function of redshift and use this, together with the rate estimates found by Thornton et al. to find an empirical relationship between event rate and redshift probed by a given survey. The non-detection of any such events in Arecibo 1.4 GHz survey data by Deneva et al., and the Allen Telescope Array survey by Simeon et al. is consistent with our model. Ongoing surveys in the 1--2 GHz band should result in further discoveries. At lower frequencies, assuming a typical radio spectral index $\alpha=-1.4$, the predicted peak flux densities are 10s of Jy. As a result, surveys of such a population with current facilities would not necessarily be sensitivity limited and could be carried out with small arrays to maximize the sky coverage. We predict that sources may already be present in 350-MHz surveys with the Green Bank Telescope. Surveys at 150 MHz with 30 deg$^2$ fields of view could detect one source per hour above 30 Jy.},

These examples correspond to the so-called regime of weak scattering. Radio pulsars scintillate as a result of scattering in the ionized interstellar medium, but in contrast to the previous cases, the physical regime corresponds to strong scattering. Pulsars exhibit two distinct kinds of variability, called diffractive scintillation and refractive scintillation, on timescales of minutes and weeks respectively. The physics of the various regimes of scintillation are reviewed, and some basic theoretical results are summarized. The properties of imaging in the presence of strong scattering are also discussed.},

abstract = {The question of whether intelligent life exists elsewhere is one of the fundamental unknowns about our Universe. Over the past decade more than 200 extra-solar planets have been discovered, providing new urgency for addressing this question in these or other planetary systems. Independently of this perspective, new radio observatories for cosmology are currently being constructed with the goal of detecting 21cm emission from cosmic hydrogen in the redshift range 6<z<15. For example, the Low-Frequency Demonstrator (LFD) of the Mileura Wide-Field Array (MWA), will cover in 8 kHz bins the entire frequency range of 80-300 MHz, which is perfectly matched to the band over which our civilization emits most of its radio power. We show that this and other low-frequency observatories (culminating with the Square Kilometer Array [SKA]) will be able to detect radio broadcast leakage from an Earth-like civilization out to a distance of ~10^{1-2.7}pc, within a spherical volume containing 10^{3-8}x(Omega_b/4*pi)^alpha stars, where alpha=1 (or 1.5) for a radar beam of solid angle Omega_b that remains steady (or sweeps) across the sky. Such a radio signal will show-up as a series of narrow spectral lines that do not coincide with known atomic or molecular lines. The high spectral resolution attainable with the upcoming observatories will allow to monitor the periodic Doppler shift of the broadcasted lines over the planet's orbital period around the parent star. Determination of the parent star mass through observations of its spectrum could then be used to infer the inclination, semi-major axis and eccentricity of the planet's orbit. This, in turn, will allow to estimate the temperature on the planet's surface and to assess whether it can support liquid water or life as we know it.

abstract = {The Crab pulsar was discovered by the occasional exceptionally bright radio pulses it emits, subsequently dubbed `giant' pulses. Only two other pulsars are known to emit giant pulses. There is no satisfactory explanation for the occurrence of giant pulses, nor is there a complete theory of the pulsar emission mechanism in general. Competing models for the radio emission mechanism can be distinguished by the temporal structure of their coherent emission. Here we report the discovery of isolated, highly polarized, two-nanosecond subpulses within the giant radio pulses from the Crab pulsar. The plasma structures responsible for these emissions must be smaller than one metre in size, making them by far the smallest objects ever detected and resolved outside the Solar System, and the brightest transient radio sources in the sky. Only one of the current models-the collapse of plasma-turbulent wave packets in the pulsar magnetosphere-can account for the nanopulses we observe.},

The Mariner 10 observations at solar elongations of 11.5 and 12.6 deg show that the density spectrum in the frequency range from 0.0001 to 0.5 Hz, which corresponds to the spatial wavenumber range of 2 millionths to 0.001 inverse km if the solar wind velocity is assumed to be 350 km/s, is approximately power-law and close to Kolmogorov (spectral index of 11/3). The results are consistent with direct spacecraft observations near earth and provide strong evidence that the density fluctuations are produced by turbulence. The potential and benefits of future extensive measurements are also discussed.},

However the errors are such that all the measurements at frequencies higher than 1.2GHz are just consistent with a single power law spectrum. A second pulsar, PSR B2021+51, with a reported excess of flux density at 43GHz, has been observed but not detected. The resulting upper limit for the flux density provides little constraint on the form of its spectrum above 43GHz.},

abstract = {We report a novel radio autocorrelation (AC) search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). For selected frequencies across the terrestrial microwave window (1-10 GHz) observations were conducted at the Allen Telescope Array to identify artificial non-sinusoidal periodic signals with radio bandwidths greater than 1 kHz, which are capable of carrying substantial messages with symbol-rates from 10-10e6 Hz. Out of 243 observations, about half (101) were directed toward sources with known continuum flux greater than 1 Jy (quasars, pulsars, supernova remnants and masers), based on the hypothesis that they might harbor heretofore undiscovered natural or artificial, repetitive, phase or frequency modulation. The rest of the targets were mostly toward exoplanet stars and similarly interesting targets from the standpoint of SETI. This campaign rules out several previously untested hypotheses relating to the number of artificially modulated "natural" sources. Since we are using a phase sensitive detector, these observations break new ground on this topic. We conclude that the maximum probability that future observations like the ones described here will reveal repetitively modulated emissions from a wide variety of sources, including quasars, supernova remnants and bright stars, is no more than 15-30 percent, depending on source type. The paper concludes by describing an approach to expanding this survey to many more targets and much greater sensitivity using archived and real-time data from interferometers all over the world.},

abstract = {This paper reports a blind search for magnetospheric emissions from planets around nearby stars. Young stars are likely to have much stronger stellar winds than the Sun, and because planetary magnetospheric emissions are powered by stellar winds, stronger stellar winds may enhance the radio luminosity of any orbiting planets. Using various stellar catalogs, we selected nearby stars (lsim30 pc) with relatively young age estimates (<3 Gyr). We constructed different samples from the stellar catalogs, finding between 100 and several hundred stars. We stacked images from the 74 MHz (4 m wavelength) VLA Low-frequency Sky Survey, obtaining 3$\sigma$ limits on planetary emission in the stacked images of between 10 and 33 mJy. These flux density limits correspond to average planetary luminosities less than 5-10 ×1023 erg s-1. Using recent models for the scaling of stellar wind velocity, density, and magnetic field with stellar age, we estimate scaling factors for the strength of stellar winds, relative to the Sun, in our samples. The typical kinetic energy carried by the stellar winds in our samples is 15-50 times larger than that of the Sun, and the typical magnetic energy is 5-10 times larger. If we assume that every star is orbited by a Jupiter-like planet with a luminosity larger than that of the Jovian decametric radiation by the above factors, our limits on planetary luminosities from the stacking analysis are likely to be a factor of 10-100 above what would be required to detect the planets in a statistical sense. Similar statistical analyses with observations by future instruments, such as the Low Frequency Array and the Long Wavelength Array, offer the promise of improvements by factors of 10-100.},

In this article we present a new kind of false positive that can mimic a disequilibrium or any other biosignature that involves two chemical species. We consider a scenario where the exoplanet hosts a moon that has its own atmosphere and neither of the atmospheres is in chemical disequilibrium. Our results show that the integrated spectrum of the planet and the moon closely resembles that of a single object in strong chemical disequilibrium. We derive a firm limit on the maximum spectral resolution that can be obtained for both directly-imaged and transiting planets. The spectral resolution of even idealized space-based spectrographs that might be achievable in the next several decades is in general insufficient to break the degeneracy. Both chemical species can only be definitively confirmed in the same object if absorption features of both chemicals can be unambiguously identified and their combined depth exceeds 100%.},

abstract = {It has been speculated that technological civilizations evolve along an energy consumption scale first formulated by Kardashev, ranging from human-like civilizations that consume energy at a rate of ∼1019 erg s-1 to hypothetical highly advanced civilizations that can consume ∼1044 erg s-1. Since the transmission power of a beacon a civilization can build depends on the energy it possesses, to make it bright enough to be seen across the Galaxy would require high technological advancement. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of a civilization using naturally-occurring radio transmitters - specifically, radio pulsars - to overcome the Kardashev limit of their developmental stage and transmit super-Kardashev power. This is achieved by the use of a modulator situated around a pulsar, that modulates the pulsar signal, encoding information onto its natural emission. We discuss a simple modulation model using pulse nulling and considerations for detecting such a signal. We find that a pulsar with a nulling modulator will exhibit an excess of thermal emission peaking in the ultraviolet during its null phases, revealing the existence of a modulator.},

abstract = {What would SETI beacon transmitters be like if built by civilizations that had a variety of motives but cared about cost? In a companion paper, we presented how, for fixed power density in the far field, a cost-optimum interstellar beacon system could be built. Here, we consider how we should search for a beacon if it were produced by a civilization similar to ours. High-power transmitters could be built for a wide variety of motives other than the need for two-way communication; this would include beacons built to be seen over thousands of light-years. Extraterrestrial beacon builders would likely have to contend with economic pressures just as their terrestrial counterparts do. Cost, spectral lines near 1 GHz, and interstellar scintillation favor radiating frequencies substantially above the classic "water hole." Therefore, the transmission strategy for a distant, cost-conscious beacon would be a rapid scan of the galactic plane with the intent to cover the angular space. Such pulses would be infrequent events for the receiver. Such beacons built by distant, advanced, wealthy societies would have very different characteristics from what SETI researchers seek. Future searches should pay special attention to areas along the galactic disk where SETI searches have seen coherent signals that have not recurred on the limited listening time intervals we have used. We will need to wait for recurring events that may arriarrive in intermittent bursts. Several new SETI search strategies have emerged from these ideas. We propose a new test for beacons that is based on the Life Plane hypotheses.},

abstract = {On Earth, how would we build galactic-scale beacons to attract the attention of extraterrestrials, as some have suggested we should do? From the point of view of expense to a builder on Earth, experience shows an optimum trade-off. This emerges by minimizing the cost of producing a desired power density at long range, which determines the maximum range of detectability of a transmitted signal. We derive general relations for cost-optimal aperture and power. For linear dependence of capital cost on transmitter power and antenna area, minimum capital cost occurs when the cost is equally divided between antenna gain and radiated power. For nonlinear power-law dependence, a similar simple division occurs. This is validated in cost data for many systems; industry uses this cost optimum as a rule of thumb. Costs of pulsed cost-efficient transmitters are estimated from these relations by using current cost parameters (/W, /m2) as a basis. We show the scaling and give examples of such beacons. Galactic-scale beacons can be built for a few billion dollars with our present technology. Such beacons have narrow "searchlight" beams and short "dwell times" when the beacon would be seen by an alien observer in their sky. More-powerful beacons are more efficient and have economies of scale: cost scales only linearly with range R, not as R2, so number of stars radiated to iincreases as the square of cost. On a cost basis, they will likely transmit at higher microwave frequencies, ˜10 GHz. The natural corridor to broadcast is along the galactic radius or along the local spiral galactic arm we are in. A companion paper asks "If someone like us were to produce a beacon, how should we look for it?"},

These stars all resemble the Sun in age and level of magnetic activity, as indicated by X-ray luminosity and chromospheric emission in Ca II H and K lines. We observed these stars with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array with sensitivities of a few $\mu$Jy at combinations of 10.0, 15.0, and 34.5 GHz. $\tau$ Cet, $\eta$ Cas A, and 40 Eri A are all detected at 34.5 GHz with signal-to-noise ratios of 6.5, 5.2, and 4.5, respectively. 15.0 GHz upper limits imply a rising spectral index greater than 1.0 for $\tau$ Cet and 1.6 for $\eta$ Cas A, at the 95% confidence level. The measured 34.5 GHz flux densities correspond to stellar disk-averaged brightness temperatures of roughly 10,000 K, similar to the solar brightness temperature at the same frequency. We explain this emission as optically thick thermal free-free emission from the chromosphere, with possible contributions from coronal gyroresonance emission above active regions and coronal free-free emission. These and similar quality data on other nearby solar-type stars, when combined with Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations, will enable the construction of temperature profiles of their chromospheres and lower transition regions.},

abstract = {Low frequency radio waves, while challenging to observe, are a rich source of information about pulsars. The LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) is a new radio interferometer operating in the lowest 4 octaves of the ionospheric "radio window": 10-240 MHz, that will greatly facilitate observing pulsars at low radio frequencies. Through the huge collecting area, long baselines, and flexible digital hardware, it is expected that LOFAR will revolutionize radio astronomy at the lowest frequencies visible from Earth. LOFAR is a next-generation radio telescope and a pathfinder to the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), in that it incorporates advanced multi-beaming techniques between thousands of individual elements. We discuss the motivation for low-frequency pulsar observations in general and the potential of LOFAR in addressing these science goals. We present LOFAR as it is designed to perform high-time-resolution observations of pulsars and other fast transients, and outline the various relevant observing modes and data reduction pipelines that are already or will soon be implemented to facilitate these observations. A number of results obtained from commissioning observations are presented to demonstrate the exciting potential of the telescope. This paper outlines the case for low frequency pulsar observations and is also intended to serve as a reference for upcoming pulsar/fast transient science papers with LOFAR.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the results of a survey for radio transients using data obtained from the Very Large Array archive. We have reduced, using a pipeline procedure, 5037 observations of the most common pointings - i.e. the calibrator fields. These fields typically contain a relatively bright point source and are used to calibrate 'target' observations: they are therefore rarely imaged themselves. The observations used span a time range ˜1984-2008 and consist of eight different pointings, three different frequencies (8.4, 4.8 and 1.4 GHz) and have a total observing time of 435 h. We have searched for transient and variable radio sources within these observations using components from the prototype LOFAR transient detection system. In this paper we present the methodology for reducing large volumes of Very Large Array data; and we also present a brief overview of the prototype LOFAR transient detection algorithms. No radio transients were detected in this survey, therefore we place an upper limit on the snapshot rate of GHz frequency transients >8.0 mJy to $\rho$≤ 0.032 deg-2 that have typical time-scales 4.3 to 45.3 d. We compare and contrast our upper limit with the snapshot rates - derived from either detections or non-detections of transient and variable radio sources - reported in the literature. When compared with the current Log N-Log S distribution formed from previous surveys, we show that our upper limit is consistent with the observed population. Current and future radio transient surveys will hopefully further constrain these statistics, and potentially discover dominant transient source populations. In this paper we also briefly explore the current transient commissioning observations with LOFAR, and the impact they will make on the field.},

abstract = {Aims: This paper discusses the spectral occupancy for performing radio astronomy with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR), with a focus on imaging observations. Methods: We have analysed the radio-frequency interference (RFI) situation in two 24-h surveys with Dutch LOFAR stations, covering 30-78 MHz with low-band antennas and 115-163 MHz with high-band antennas. This is a subset of the full frequency range of LOFAR. The surveys have been observed with a 0.76 kHz/1 s resolution. Results: We measured the RFI occupancy in the low and high frequency sets to be 1.8% and 3.2% respectively. These values are found to be representative values for the LOFAR radio environment. Between day and night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. We find that lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of LOFAR results in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. At LOFAR's nominal resolution of 0.76 kHz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5%. This rate increases approximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution. Conclusions: Currently, by using an automated RFI detection strategy, the LOFAR radio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. It remains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations that integrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. Reasons for the low impact of RFI are the high spectral and time resolution of LOFAR; accurate detection methods; strong filters and high receiver linearity; and the proximity of the antennas to the ground. We discuss some strategies that can be used once low-level RFI starts to become apparent. It is important that the frequency range of LOFAR remains free of broadband interference, such as DAB stations and windmills.},

The heliocentric distance range covered is 2-215 solar radii and for some observations close to the sun the spectra extend to fluctuation frequencies as high as 100 Hz. For heliocentric distances of about 20 solar radii the equivalent spacecraft-measured one-dimensional density spectrum is well modeled by a single power law in the frequency range 0.0001-0.05 Hz. The flattening of the density spectrum within 20 solar radii is presumably associated with energy deposition in the near-sun region and acceleration of the solar wind.},

Both phase-shift keying (PSK) and frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation schemes are considered. It is shown that M-ary FSK is advantageous in terms of energy. Narrow-band pulses scattered over the spectrum sharing a common drift rate can be the probable signals of ETI. Modern SETI spectrum analyzers are well suited to searching for these types of signals. Such signals can be detected using the Hough transform which is a dedicated tool for detecting patterns in an image. The time-frequency plane representing the power output of the spectrum analyzer during the search for ETI gives an image from which the Hough transform (HT) can detect signal patterns with frequency drift.},

Our survey covered a total of 1147 square degrees of sky using a drift-scan technique. We detected 33 pulsars, 10 of which were not known prior to the survey observations. The highlight of the new discoveries is PSR J0407+1607, which has a spin period of 25.7 ms, a characteristic age of 1.5 Gyr and is in a 1.8-yr orbit about a low-mass (>0.2 Msun) companion. The long orbital period and small eccentricity (e = 0.0009) make the binary system an important new addition to the ensemble of binary pulsars suitable to test for violations of the strong equivalence principle. We also report on our initially unsuccessful attempts to detect optically the companion to J0407+1607 which imply that its absolute visual magnitude is > 12.1. If, as expected on evolutionary grounds, the companion is an He white dwarf, our non-detection imples a cooling age of least 1 Gyr.

The STACEE detector offers unprecedented light-collecting capability for the detection of nanosecond pulses from such lasers. We estimate STACEE's sensitivity to be approximately 10 photons/m2 at a wavelength of 420 nm. The stars have been chosen because their characteristics are such that they may harbor habitable planets, and they are relatively close to Earth. Each star was observed for 10 minutes, and we found no evidence for laser pulses in any of the data sets.

The basic procedure involves computing the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of some decision statistic derived from the received signal, and comparing it with the CDFs of the signal under each candidate modulation format. The K-S-based modulation classifier is first developed for AWGN channel, then it is applied to OFDM-SDMA systems to cancel multiuser interference. Regarding the complexity issue of K-S modulation classification, we propose a low-complexity method based on the robustness of the K-S classifier. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that compared with the traditional cumulant-based classifiers, the proposed K-S classifier offers superior classification performance and requires less number of signal samples (thus is fast).},

This paper propose an algorithm based on first-order and second-order cyclostationarity for joint detection and classification of frequency shift keying (FSK), minimum shift keying (MSK), and pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) signals. The proposed algorithm has the advantage that it avoids the need for timing and frequency recovery, and estimation of signal and noise powers. Simulations are given to verify the performance of the algorithm.},

For example, SKA1-MID will be capable of detecting a source roughly analogous to terrestrial high-power radars (e.g. air route surveillance or ballistic missile warning radars, EIRP (EIRP = equivalent isotropic radiated power, ~10^17 erg sec^-1) at 10 pc in less than 15 minutes, and with a modest four beam SETI observing system could, in one minute, search every star in the primary beam out to ~100 pc for radio emission comparable to that emitted by the Arecibo Planetary Radar (EIRP ~2 x 10^20 erg sec^-1). The flexibility of the signal detection systems used for SETI searches with the SKA will allow new algorithms to be employed that will provide sensitivity to a much wider variety of signal types than previously searched for. Here we discuss the astrobiological and astrophysical motivations for radio SETI and describe how the technical capabilities of the SKA will explore the radio SETI parameter space. We detail several conceivable SETI experimental programs on all components of SKA1, including commensal, primary-user, targeted and survey programs and project the enhancements to them possible with SKA2. We also discuss target selection criteria for these programs, and in the case of commensal observing, how the varied use cases of other primary observers can be used to full advantage for SETI.},

abstract = {The primary challenge of rocket propulsion is the burden of needing to accelerate the spacecraft's own fuel, resulting in only a logarithmic gain in maximum speed as propellant is added to the spacecraft. Light sails offer an attractive alternative in which fuel is not carried by the spacecraft, with acceleration being provided by an external source of light. By artificially illuminating the spacecraft with beamed radiation, speeds are only limited by the area of the sail, heat resistance of its material, and power use of the accelerating apparatus. In this paper, we show that leakage from a light sail propulsion apparatus in operation around a solar system analogue would be detectable. To demonstrate this, we model the launch and arrival of a microwave beam-driven light sail constructed for transit between planets in orbit around a single star, and find an optimal beam frequency on the order of tens of GHz. Leakage from these beams yields transients with flux densities of 0.1 Jy and durations of seconds at 100 pc. Because most travel within a planetary system would be conducted between the habitable worlds within that system, multiply-transiting exoplanetary systems offer the greatest chance of detection, especially when the planets are in projected conjunction as viewed from Earth. If interplanetary travel via beam-driven light sails is commonly employed in our galaxy, this activity could be revealed by radio follow-up of nearby transiting exoplanetary systems. The expected signal properties define a new strategy in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).},

abstract = {Project Phoenix, the privately funded continuation of NASA's Targeted Search SETI Program, has taken advantage of the wide frequency coverage made possible by the upgraded Arecibo Telescope. Our goal is to search for evidence of narrowband extraterrestrial radio signals from nearby stars in the microwave portion of the spectrum. The signal detection system processes a 20-MHz bandwidth with 1-Hz wide channels in each of two circular polarizations. The system is sensitive to signals that are continuously present, or pulsed regularly, even if their frequencies drift by up to about 1 Hz per second. A database of terrestrial signals found in the previous week is used to match against detections for each observation. Candidate signals, i.e., those not in the database, are checked immediately with a ``pseudo-interferometric'' observation between Arecibo and the 76-m Lovell Telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory. Since 1998 October, we have conducted approximately 8 weeks of observations at L-Band, 1200 to 1750 MHz. Approximately 180 MHz of that range is too heavily occupied by terrestrial signals for effective observing.},

abstract = {We report new, more sensitive observations of nine of the 11 extrastatistical signals in the Megachannel Extraterrestrial Assay (META). These extrastatistical signals had all the expected characteristics of a transmission from an extraterrestrial transmitter, except that they did not repeat. Cordes, Lazio, {\&} Sagan showed that this lack of repeatability could be explained by the high detection thresholds used in the reobservations of these candidates, combined with interstellar scintillation of intrinsically steady sources. We use the Cordes et al. methodology, correcting an error in the original presentation, and our new observations to rule out this scintillation hypothesis at a confidence level of at least 97.8% (for the case of an intrinsically weak source) and to a level in excess of 99% (if the source strengths are comparable to the value favored by Cordes et al.). We also demonstrate that gravitational microlensing cannot account for the initial detection of these candidate signals, nor is gravitational lensing likely to play a role in future SETI programs. We conclude that the META candidates do not reflect a large population of powerful, strong beacons.},

abstract = {SETI@home, a search for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence, has been recording data at the Arecibo radio telescope since 1999. These data are sent via the Internet to the personal computers of volunteers who have donated their computers' idle time toward this search. To date, SETI@home volunteers have detected more than 4.2 billion potential signals. While essentially all of these potential signals are due to random noise processes, radio frequency interference (RFI), or interference processes in the SETI@home instrumentation, it is possible that a true extraterrestrial transmission exists within this database. Herein we describe the process of interference removal being implemented in the SETI@home post-processing pipeline, as well as those methods being used to identify candidates worthy of further investigation.

abstract = {The LSPM catalog is a comprehensive list of 61,977 stars north of the J2000 celestial equator that have proper motions larger than 0.15" yr-1 (local-background-stars frame). The catalog has been generated primarily as a result of our systematic search for high proper motion stars in the Digitized Sky Surveys using our SUPERBLINK software. At brighter magnitudes, the catalog incorporates stars and data from the Tycho-2 Catalogue and also, to a lesser extent, from the All-Sky Compiled Catalogue of 2.5 million stars. The LSPM catalog considerably expands over the old Luyten (Luyten Half-Second [LHS] and New Luyten Two-Tenths [NLTT]) catalogs, superseding them for northern declinations. Positions are given with an accuracy of <~100 mas at the 2000.0 epoch, and absolute proper motions are given with an accuracy of ~8 mas yr-1. Corrections to the local-background-stars proper motions have been calculated, and absolute proper motions in the extragalactic frame are given. Whenever available, we also give optical BT and VT magnitudes (from Tycho-2, ASCC-2.5), photographic BJ, RF, and IN magnitudes (from USNO-B1 catalog), and infrared J, H, and Ks magnitudes (from 2MASS). We also provide an estimated V magnitude and V-J color for nearly all catalog entries, useful for initial classification of the stars. The catalog is estimated to be over 99% complete at high Galactic latitudes (|b|>15deg) and over 90% complete at low Galactic latitudes (|b|>15deg), down to a magnitude V=19.0, and has a limiting magnitude V=21.0. All the northern stars listed in the LHS and NLTT catalogs have been reidentified, and their positions, proper motions, and magnitudes reevaluated. The catalog also lists a large number of completely new objects, which promise to expand very significantly the census of red dwarfs, subdwarfs, and white dwarfs in the vicinity of the Sun. Based on data mining of the Digitized Sky Surveys (DSSs), developed and operated by the Catalogs and Surveys Branch of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), Baltimore. Developed with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), as part of the NASA/NSF NStars program.},

The 8889 stars are selected from the ongoing SUPERBLINK survey of stars with proper motion $\mu$ > 40 mas yr-1, supplemented on the bright end with the Tycho-2 catalog. Completeness tests which account for kinematic (proper motion) bias suggest that our catalog represents ≈75% of the estimated ~11, 900 M dwarfs with J < 10 expected to populate the entire sky. Our catalog is, however, significantly more complete for the northern sky (≈90%) than it is for the south (≈60%). Stars are identified as cool, red M dwarfs from a combination of optical and infrared color cuts, and are distinguished from background M giants and highly reddened stars using either existing parallax measurements or, if such measurements are lacking, using their location in an optical-to-infrared reduced proper motion diagram. These bright M dwarfs are all prime targets for exoplanet surveys using the Doppler radial velocity or transit methods; the combination of low-mass and bright apparent magnitude should make possible the detection of Earth-size planets on short-period orbits using currently available techniques. Parallax measurements, when available, and photometric distance estimates are provided for all stars, and these place most systems within 60 pc of the Sun. Spectral type estimated from V - J color shows that most of the stars range from K7 to M4, with only a few late M dwarfs, all within 20 pc. Proximity to the Sun also makes these stars good targets for high-resolution exoplanet imaging searches, especially if younger objects can be identified on the basis of X-ray or UV excess. For that purpose, we include X-ray flux from ROSAT and FUV/NUV ultraviolet magnitudes from GALEX for all stars for which a counterpart can be identified in those catalogs. Additional photometric data include optical magnitudes from Digitized Sky Survey plates and infrared magnitudes from the Two Micron All Sky Survey.},

abstract = {Power-spectrum analysis is an important tool providing critical information about a signal. The range of applications includes communication-systems to DNA-sequencing. If there is interference present on a transmitted signal, it could be due to a natural cause or superimposed forcefully. In the latter case, its early detection and analysis becomes important. In such situations having a small observation window, a quick look at power-spectrum can reveal a great deal of information, including frequency and source of interference. In this paper, we present our design of a FPGA based reconfigurable platform for high performance power-spectrum analysis. This allows for the real-time data-acquisition and processing of samples of the incoming signal in a small time frame. The processing consists of computation of power, its average and peak, over a set of input values. This platform sustains simultaneous data streams on each of the four input channels.},

abstract = {Context: Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are located at the photometric and dynamical centers of the majority of galaxies. They are among the densest star clusters in the Universe. The NSC in the Milky Way is the only object of this class that can be resolved into individual stars. The massive black hole Sagittarius A* is located at the dynamical center of the Milky Way NSC. Aims: In this work we examine the proper motions of stars out to distances of 1.0 pc from Sgr A*. The aim is to examine the velocity structure of the MW NSC and acquire a reliable estimate of the stellar mass in the central parsec of the MW NSC, in addition to the well-known black hole mass. Methods: We use multi-epoch adaptive optics assisted near-infrared observations of the central parsec of the Galaxy obtained with NACO/CONICA at the ESO VLT. Stellar positions are measured via PSF fitting in the individual images and transformed into a common reference frame via suitable sets of reference stars. Results: We measured the proper motions of more than 6000 stars within ~1.0 pc of Sagittarius A*. The full data set is provided in this work. We largely exclude the known early-type stars with their peculiar dynamical properties from the dynamical analysis. The cluster is found to rotate parallel to Galactic rotation, while the velocity dispersion appears isotropic (or anisotropy may be masked by the cluster rotation). The Keplerian fall-off of the velocity dispersion due to the point mass of Sgr A* is clearly detectable only at R ⪉ 0.3 pc. Nonparametric isotropic and anisotropic Jeans models are applied to the data. They imply a best-fit black hole mass of 3.6^+0.2-0.4 × 106 M{\&}sun;. Although this value is slightly lower than the current canonical value of 4.0 × 106 M{\&}sun;, this is the first time that a proper motion analysis provides a mass for Sagittarius A* that is consistent with the mass inferred from orbits of individual stars. The point mass of Sagittarius A* is not sufficient to explain the velocity data. In addition to the black hole, the models require the presence of an extended mass of 0.5-1.5 × 106 M{\&}sun; in the central parsec. This is the first time that the extended mass of the nuclear star cluster is unambiguously detected. The influence of the extended mass on the gravitational potential becomes notable at distances ⪆0.4 pc from Sgr A*. Constraints on the distribution of this extended mass are weak. The extended mass can be explained well by the mass of the stars that make up the cluster.

abstract = {We relate the underlying properties of a population of fast radio-emitting transient events to its expected detection rate in a survey of finite sensitivity. The distribution of the distances of the detected events is determined in terms of the population luminosity distribution and survey parameters, for both extragalactic and Galactic populations. The detection rate as a function of Galactic position is examined to identify regions that optimize survey efficiency in a survey whose field of view is limited. The impact of temporal smearing caused by scattering in the Interstellar Medium has a large and direction-dependent bearing on the detection of impulsive signals, and we present a model for the effects of scattering on the detection rate. We show the detection rate scales as Omega S0^{-3/2 + delta}, where Omega is the field of view, and S0 is the minimum detectable flux density, and 0 < delta =< 3/2 for a survey of Galactic transients in which interstellar scattering or the finite volume of the Galaxy is important. We derive formal conditions on the optimal survey strategy to adopt under different circumstances for fast transients surveys on next generation large-element, widefield arrays, such as ASKAP, LOFAR, the MWA and the SKA, and show how interstellar scattering and the finite spatial extent of a Galactic population modify the choice of optimal strategy.

abstract = {We use the sample of known stars and brown dwarfs within 5 pc of the Sun, supplemented with AFGK stars within 10 pc, to determine which stellar spectral types provide the most habitable real estate---defined as locations where liquid water could be present on Earth-like planets. Stellar temperatures and radii are determined by fitting model spectra to spatially resolved broadband photometric energy distributions for stars in the sample. Using these values, the locations of the habitable zones are calculated using an empirical formula for planetary surface temperature and assuming the condition of liquid water, called here the empirical habitable zone (EHZ). Systems that have dynamically disruptive companions are considered not habitable. We consider companions to be disruptive if the separation ratio of the companion to the habitable zone is less than 5:1. We use the results of these calculations to derive a simple formula for predicting the location of the EHZ for main sequence stars based on V - K color. We consider EHZ widths as more useful measures of the habitable real estate around stars than areas because multiple planets are not expected to orbit stars at identical stellar distances. This EHZ provides a qualitative guide on where to expect the largest population of planets in the habitable zones of main sequence stars. Because of their large numbers and lower frequency of short-period companions, M stars provide more EHZ real estate than other spectral types, possessing 36.5% of the habitable real estate en masse. K stars are second with 21.5%, while A, F, and G stars offer 18.5%, 6.9%, and 16.6%, respectively. Our calculations show that three M dwarfs within 10 pc harbor planets in their EHZs---GJ 581 may have two planets (d with msin i = 6.1 M ⊕ g with msin i = 3.1 M ⊕), GJ 667 C has one (c with msin i = 4.5 M ⊕), and GJ 876 has two (b with msin i = 1.89 M Jup and c with msin i = 0.56 M Jup). If Earth-like planets are as common around low-mass stars as recent Kepler results suggest, M stars will harbor more Earth-like planets in habitable zones than any other stellar spectral type.},

abstract = {It is noted that the term 'interstellar dust' refers to materials with rather different properties, and that the mean extinction law of Seaton (1979) or Savage and Mathis (1979) should be replaced by the expression given by Cardelli et al. (1989), using the appropriate value of total-to-selective extinction. The older laws were appropriate for the diffuse ISM but dust in clouds differs dramatically in its extinction law. Dust is heavily processed while in the ISM by being included within clouds and cycled back into the diffuse ISM many times during its lifetime. Hence, grains probably reflect only a trace of their origin, although meteoritic inclusions with isotopic anomalies demonstrate that some tiny particles survive intact from a supernova origin to the present.},

abstract = {A directed search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) has been carried out using the IRAM 30m telescope. Following a suggestion by Kardashev (1979), the search was conducted at the spin-flip line of the lightest atom, namely positronium, at 203GHz. Most of the 17 targets are mature stars with excess infrared radiation, which might be the waste heat of a power-rich technological civilisation. The rest frame of the cosmic background radiation was chosen as the velocity frame. The spectral resolution used was 9.7kHz. From the noise level, which was determined by the limited telescope time and weather conditions, the upper limit for the power of artificial omnidirectional transmitters at the positronium line frequency is of order 10^15^W. The relevance of this non-detection is discussed.},

One goal is a roadmap to the design of such systems, aimed at future designers of either receivers (SETI) or transmitters (METI). In particular we emphasize the implications arising from the impossibility of coordination between transmitter and receiver prior to a receiver's search for a signal. A system architecture based on layering, as commonly used in network and software design, assists in organizing and categorizing the various design issues and identifying dependencies. Implications of impairments introduced in the interstellar medium, such as dispersion, scattering, Doppler, noise, and signal attenuation are discussed. Less fundamental (but nevertheless influential) design issues are the motivations of the transmitter designers and associated resource requirements at both transmitter and receiver. Unreliability is inevitably imposed by non-idealities in the physical communication channel, and this unreliability will have substantial implications for those seeking to convey interstellar messages.},

abstract = {The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS ) will search for planets transiting bright and nearby stars. TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its two-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical CCD cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with IC (approximately less than) 13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from one month to one year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10-100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every four months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

These bright sources comprise >99% of the known, northern M dwarfs with apparent magnitudes J<9, and most likely include >95% of all such existing objects. Only 679 stars in our sample are listed in the Third Catalog of Nearby Stars (CNS3); most others are relative unknowns and have spectroscopic data presented here for the first time. Observations confirm 1,403 of the candidates to be late-K and M dwarfs with spectral subtypes K7-M6, with subtypes assigned based on spectral index measurements of CaH and TiO molecular bands. We also calculate the Zeta parameter, which measures the ratio of TiO and CaH bandheads, and is correlated with metallicity in M dwarfs/subdwarfs, and for this we present a revised calibration based on corrected values of the CaH and TiO spectral indices. Fits of our spectra to the Phoenix atmospheric model grid are used to estimate effective temperatures. Existing geometric parallax measurements for 624 of the catalog stars are used to recalibrate the subtype/absolute magnitude relationship in M dwarfs; we find that spectroscopic distances are marginally more accurate at earlier (K7-M2) subtypes, but that photometric distances should be preferred for later-type dwarfs (M3-M6). We identify active stars from H$\alpha$ equivalent widths, GALEX UV magnitudes, and ROSAT X-ray fluxes from ROSAT. We combine proper motion data and photometric distances to evaluate the distribution in (U,V,W) velocity space of the entire catalog. The overall velocity-space distribution correlates tightly with the velocity distribution of G dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood. However, active stars show a smaller dispersion in their space velocities, which is consistent with those stars being younger on average.},

Using the positions of red clump stars in color-magnitude diagrams as a tracer of the extinction and reddening, we determine the average of the ratios of total to selective extinction to be AKs/EH-Ks=1.44+/-0.01, AKs/EJ-Ks=0.494+/-0.006, and AH/EJ-H=1.42+/-0.02, which are significantly smaller than those obtained in previous studies. From these ratios, we estimate that AJ:AH:AKs=1:0.573+/-0.009:0.331+/-0.004 and EJ-H/EH-Ks=1.72+/-0.04, and we find that the power law A$\lambda$~$\lambda$-1.99+/-0.02 is a good approximation over these wavelengths. Moreover, we find a small variation in AKs/EH-Ks across our survey. This suggests that the infrared extinction law changes from one line of sight to another, and the so-called universality does not necessarily hold in the infrared wavelengths.},

abstract = {Spread spectrum, widely employed in modern digital wireless terrestrial radio systems, chooses a signal with a noise-like character and much higher bandwidth than necessary. This paper advocates spread spectrum modulation for interstellar communication, motivated by robust immunity to radio-frequency interference (RFI) of technological origin in the vicinity of the receiver while preserving full detection sensitivity in the presence of natural sources of noise. Receiver design for noise immunity alone provides no basis for choosing a signal with any specific character, therefore failing to reduce ambiguity. By adding RFI to noise immunity as a design objective, the conjunction of choice of signal (by the transmitter) together with optimum detection for noise immunity (in the receiver) leads through simple probabilistic argument to the conclusion that the signal should possess the statistical properties of a burst of white noise, and also have a large time-bandwidth product. Thus spread spectrum also provides an implicit coordination between transmitter and receiver by reducing the ambiguity as to the signal character. This strategy requires the receiver to guess the specific noise-like signal, and it is contended that this is feasible if an appropriate pseudorandom signal is generated algorithmically. For example, conceptually simple algorithms like the binary expansion of common irrational numbers like Pi are shown to be suitable. Due to its deliberately wider bandwidth, spread spectrum is more susceptible to dispersion and distortion in propagation through the interstellar medium, desirably reducing ambiguity in parameters like bandwidth and carrier frequency. This suggests a promising new direction in interstellar communication using spread spectrum modulation techniques.

These new X-ray observations resulted in a detection rate of almost 94% for all K and M stars within 6 pc around the Sun, and 87% for K and M dwarfs within 7 pc around the Sun. The resulting X-ray luminosity distribution function can be well described by a log-normal distribution; the largest and smallest X-ray luminosities from our sample stars differ by almost four orders of magnitude. We show the existence of a correlation between total emitted X-ray luminosity and spectral hardness, such that more luminous objects tend to have larger spectral hardness, thus implying higher coronal temperatures. A comparison with Einstein data shows the lack of significant variability in excess of a factor of 2 in our sample stars.},

abstract = {Motivated by recent observations that suggest a low density of old stars around the Milky Way supermassive black hole (SMBH), models for the nuclear star cluster are considered that have not yet reached a steady state under the influence of gravitational encounters. A core of initial radius 1-1.5 pc evolves to a size of approximately 0.5 pc after 10 Gyr, roughly the size of the observed core. The absence of a Bahcall-Wolf cusp is naturally explained in these models, without the need for fine-tuning or implausible initial conditions. In the absence of a cusp, the time for a 10 M sun black hole (BH) to spiral in to the Galactic center from an initial distance of 5 pc can be much greater than 10 Gyr. Assuming that the stellar BHs had the same phase-space distribution initially as the stars, their density after 5-10 Gyr is predicted to rise very steeply going into the stellar core, but could remain substantially below the densities inferred from steady-state models that include a steep density cusp in the stars. Possible mechanisms for the creation of the parsec-scale initial core include destruction of stars on centrophilic orbits in a pre-existing triaxial nucleus, inhibited star formation near the SMBH, or ejection of stars by a massive binary. The implications of these models are discussed for the rates of gravitational-wave inspiral events, as well as other physical processes that depend on a high density of stars or stellar-mass BHs near SgrA*.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a signal processing concept for imaging the sky at millisecond rates with radio interferometers. The "Pocket Correlator" (PoCo) correlates the signals from multiple elements of a radio interferometer fast enough to image brief, dispersed pulses. By the nature of interferometry, a millisecond correlator functions like a large, single-dish telescope, but with improved survey speed, spatial localization, calibration, and interference rejection. To test the concept, we installed PoCo at the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) to search for dispersed pulses from the Crab pulsar, B0329+54, and M31 using total-power, visibility-based, and image-plane techniques. In 1.7 hours of observing, PoCo detected 191 giant pulses from the Crab pulsar brighter than a typical 5 sigma sensitivity limit of 60 Jy over pulse widths of 3 milliseconds. Roughly 40% of pulses from pulsar B0329+54 were detected by using novel visibility-based techniques. Observations of M31 constrain the rate of pulses brighter than 190 Jy in a three degree region surrounding the galaxy to <4.3/hr. We calculate the computational demand of various visibility-based pulse search algorithms and demonstrate how compute clusters can help meet this demand. Larger implementations of the fast imaging concept will conduct blind searches for millisecond pulses in our Galaxy and beyond, providing a valuable probe of the interstellar/intergalactic media, discovering new kinds of radio transients, and localizing them to constrain models of their origin.},

abstract = {The detection of radio pulsars within the central few parsecs of the Galaxy would provide a unique probe of the gravitational and magneto-ionic environments in the Galactic Center (GC) and, if close enough to Sgr A*, precise tests of general relativity in the strong-field regime. While it is difficult to find pulsars at radio wavelengths because of interstellar scattering, the payoff from detailed timing of pulsars in the GC warrants a concerted effort. To motivate pulsar surveys and help define search parameters for them, we constrain the pulsar number and spatial distribution using a wide range of multiwavelength measurements. These include the five known radio pulsars within 15 arcmin of Sgr A*, radio and gamma-ray measurements of diffuse emission, non-detections in high frequency pulsar surveys of the central parsec, a catalog of radio point sources from an imaging survey, infrared observations of massive star populations in the central few parsecs, candidate pulsar wind nebulae in the inner 20 pc and estimates of the core-collapse supernova rate based on X-ray measurements. We find that under current observational constraints, the inner parsec of the Galaxy could harbor as many as ~10^3 active radio pulsars that are beamed towards Earth. Such a large population would distort the low-frequency measurements of both the intrinsic spectrum of Sgr A* and the free-free absorption along the line of sight of Sgr A*.},

abstract = {Stable, hydrogen-burning, M dwarf stars make up about 75% of all stars in the Galaxy. They are extremely long-lived, and because they are much smaller in mass than the Sun (between 0.5 and 0.08 MSun), their temperature and stellar luminosity are low and peaked in the red. We have re-examined what is known at present about the potential for a terrestrial planet forming within, or migrating into, the classic liquid-surface-water habitable zone close to an M dwarf star. Observations of protoplanetary disks suggest that planet-building materials are common around M dwarfs, but N-body simulations differ in their estimations of the likelihood of potentially habitable, wet planets that reside within their habitable zones, which are only about one-fifth to 1/50th of the width of that for a G star. Particularly in light of the claimed detection of the planets with masses as small as 5.5 and 7.5 MEarth orbiting M stars, there seems no reason to exclude the possibility of terrestrial planets. Tidally locked synchronous rotation within the narrow habitable zone does not necessarily lead to atmospheric collapse, and active stellar flaring may not be as much of an evolutionarily disadvantageous factor as has previously been supposed. We conclude that M dwarf stars may indeed be viable hosts for planets on which the origin and evolution of life can occur. A number of planetary processes such as cessation of geothermal activity or thermal and nonthermal atmospheric loss processes may limit the duration of planetary habitability to periods far shorter than the extreme lifetime of the M dwarf star. Nevertheless, it makes sense to include M dwarf stars in programs that seek to find habitable worlds and evidence of life.

abstract = {We propose that the 100 ft diameter antenna at Los Canos, near Arecibo, be used with the 1000 ft Arecibo telescopes to reduce the effects of RF interference in SETI observations. Because of its large collecting area, the 1000 ft telescope at Arecibo is a prime instrument for SETI. On the other hand, RFI will limit its usefulness. Because any ETI signal will be of extraterrestrial origin, its detection at the larger antenna will be accompanied by a similar detection in the smaller antenna, at a lower level, if it is pointed in the same direction. A detector which multiplies the outputs of the two antennas, an interferometer, can serve as an anticoincidence discriminator against RF interference. We describe a strategy for observations in which such an interferometer can operate either in parallel with a single detector at the large telescope, or in sequence to verify at ETI detection. The recent survey studies of RFI at the Goldstone Observatory (Klein et al., 1987, this volume) provide examples of the nature of the interference that may be encountered at Arecibo. We show that the multiplying detector can reduce the effects of RF interference by between 20 and 30 dB.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have obtained promising results in difficult deep learning tasks. However, the success of a CNN depends on finding an architecture to fit a given problem. A hand-crafted architecture is a challenging, time-consuming process that requires expert knowledge and effort, due to a large number of architectural design choices. In this article, we present an efficient framework that automatically designs a high-performing CNN architecture for a given problem. In this framework, we introduce a new optimization objective function that combines the error rate and the information learnt by a set of feature maps using deconvolutional networks (deconvnet). The new objective function allows the hyperparameters of the CNN architecture to be optimized in a way that enhances the performance by guiding the CNN through better visualization of learnt features via deconvnet. The actual optimization of the objective function is carried out via the Nelder-Mead Method (NMM). Further, our new objective function results in much faster convergence towards a better architecture. The proposed framework has the ability to explore a CNN architectureâs numerous design choices in an efficient way and also allows effective, distributed execution and synchronization via web services. Empirically, we demonstrate that the CNN architecture designed with our approach outperforms several existing approaches in terms of its error rate. Our results are also competitive with state-of-the-art results on the MNIST dataset and perform reasonably against the state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Our approach has a significant role in increasing the depth, reducing the size of strides, and constraining some convolutional layers not followed by pooling layers in order to find a CNN architecture that produces a high recognition performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep learning (DL) is a powerful technique which has achieved great success in many applications. However, its usage in communication systems has not been well explored. This paper investigates algorithms for multi-signals detection and modulation classification, which are significant in many communication systems. In this work, a DL framework for multi-signals detection and modulation recognition is proposed. Compared to some existing methods, the signal modulation format, center frequency, and start-stop time can be obtained from the proposed scheme. Furthermore, two types of networks are built: (1) Single shot multibox detector (SSD) networks for signal detection and (2) multi-inputs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for modulation recognition. Additionally, the importance of signal representation to different tasks is investigated. Experimental results demonstrate that the DL framework is capable of detecting and recognizing signals. And compared to the traditional methods and other deep network techniques, the current built DL framework can achieve better performance.},
