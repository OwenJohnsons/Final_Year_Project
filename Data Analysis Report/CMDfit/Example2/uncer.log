 For (AGE)/10^6 one parameter of interest.
 Since the best value is    1.99526322      and the lower limit is 
   6.65889883      we can only derive an upper limit.
   68.2600021      percent limit is <   7.34643984    
  
 For DISTANCE MODULUS one parameter of interest.
 Since the best value is    9.00000000      and the lower limit is 
   9.30894279      we can only derive an upper limit.
   68.2600021      percent limit is <   10.3619995
