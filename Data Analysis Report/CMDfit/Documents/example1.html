<h2> Example 1 - High-mass stars.</h2>

<p>
This example is the fit to the high-mass stars presented in 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?doi=10.1111%2Fj.1365-2966.2007.11327.x&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=45c84b2a4721026">Jeffries
et al (2007)</a>.
The output files are given in the download in a directory called
Example1, but you should create a clean directory to try it in.
The precise inputs to the programs are given in 
a series of files with the suffix .in also in the Example1 directory.
</p>
<p>
First we run monte to create the 2D isochrone.
We will need a mass range of 1 to 16 solar masses.
We will use the Geneva isochrones with the colours supplied with the
isochrones (option 0), specifically V vs B-V.
We require a binary fraction of 0.5.
Since we only require one age, we set the age "range" to go from log10(age)
is 7 to 7.
</p>

<p>
Monte tends to take a couple of minutes to run (on my PC at least), but
at the end produces a file called V_B-V_07.000.fit.
This is a genuine FITS file, so you can
use your favourite FITS reader to look at it, and convince yourself
that its right.
</p>

<p>      
Now you need to run grid.  
The input data catalogue is called ubv.cat (which you can copy 
from CMDfit/Example1).
This has U-B as well as B-V in it, so you'll be prompted for which colours
you want (numbers 1 and 2 on the list).
Next you can add an extra uncertainty to the 
magnitudes and colours of each star.
This is added in quadrature to the uncertainties given in the data
file.
In this case, though, you should give the extra uncertainty to be
added as zero.
Next come the details of the isochrones you are using.
The log10(age) range is 7 to 7, and
you should search a distance modulus range of 9.7 to 10.5, with 100
points in the "grid".     
Finally, E(B-V)=0.20.
You are now asked for the fraction of stars which are members, and as
this is a good membership list the answer is 1.
</p>

<p>
There are a host of useful output files. 
The tau-squared space in this case is a simple plot of tau-squared
against distance, and is given in grid.fit.
Normally this is a two-dimensional space (say age and distance), and
so is given as a FITS file (hence its extension).
In this case, though, as its just one dimensional there is also 
a simple ASCII file (grid.asc).
The best fitting CMD, best_model.fit is also a FITS file.
Obviously you want to see the data overlaid on this.
We use the Starlink program gaia to look at images, and so provide you
with the program for_gaia, which will take your data file (ubv.cat)
and an image (in this case best_model.fit) to give you a regions
definition file (ubv.ard), which the regions sub-menu in gaia allows
you to plot the data over the model.
For final publication plots you may wish to cut down the size of the
FITS image, and bin it up in magnitude, before using for_gaia.
Your favourite data reduction package will no doubt do this, but we
also provide binup and subset to do it.
<p>
</p>        
The output from grid should tell you that the best fitting value of
parameter 2 (the distance modulus) was about 10.11, for a tau-squared of
3.8 (though your answers may deviate slightly due to the the random
process which generates the models).
As explained in the paper, the tau-squared alone is meaningless, you
need the reduced tau-squared.  
You do this using the program tau2.
You are first prompted for the best fitting model (best_model.fit),
then you need the remaining data points after clipping, which was 
written for you by grid into fitted.cat (though this should be
identical to ubv.cat, provided you have not added an extra uncertainty
in grid).
Next you will be prompted for the number of the magnitude (1) and
colour (2) being fitted
from this file and the number of free parameters (1).
This program tells you probability that the model is a good description 
of the data (Pr(tau-squared).
You will find that the chance of exceeding the 3.8 grid gave us, is 
around 0.05.
Thus this fit is on the margins of being acceptable, but we probably
cannot justify clipping points out. 
<p>
</p>
Finally, if you want to work out a confidence interval you need to run
uncer.
It automatically reads the file which is the
tau-squared grid from grid (grid.fit) and writes a file called uncer.out,
which is the tau-squared levels for given percentage confidence levels.
It prints the 68 percent confidence level to the screen, 
which it should say is a tau-squared of 382.
If you look back at grid.fit.asc you find this gives you a 68 percent
confidence interval in distance modulus of 10.06 to 10.18, but again 
these numbers are also printed to the screen.
These values deviate slightly, but not significantly from those in Jeffries et
al. partly because of randomness, but partly due to improvements in the 
technique and the software since that paper was published.
