<p>
In <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2006MNRAS.373.1251N&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=45c84b2a4721026">Naylor
and Jeffries (2006)</a> we introduced a new
maximum likelihood statistic, tau-squared.  

Although its clear this can have widespread
applications, for the moment we are concentrating on developing it to
fit colour-magnitude diagrams.  The technique is described in that
paper, though there are some improvements we have made since which 
are described in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.399..432N">Naylor (2009)</a>.
You can see our applications of it to measure ages and distances to
young clusters in
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.445.3496B">Bell et al (2014)</a>,
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.434..806B">Bell et al (2013)</a>,
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.403..545L">Littlefair et al (2010)</a>,
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.399..432N">Naylor (2009)</a>,
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.393..538J">Jeffries et al (2009)</a>,
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.386..261M">Mayne & Naylor (2008)</a> and
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.376..580J">Jeffries et al (2007)</a>.
It has been used by other groups for other clusters by
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AJ....145..134C">Curtis et al (2013)</a>,
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AJ....140..677C">Cargile & James (2010)</a> and
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008arXiv0809.1725J">Joshi et al (2008)</a>.
Finally
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...723..166D">Da Rio et al (2010)</a>
have extended the method to measure ages spreads in the Orion Nebula Cluster.

Our aim here is to provide the where-with-all for you to fit data.
The software is still being developed, so you may well find you cannot
just pick it up and use it on your favourite dataset.  But we hope to
provide you with enough that given a little thought, you can carry out
fits with relatively little effort.  In that spirit, therefore, we
provide software that you can download, a user manual, and some worked
examples.  Equally importantly, though, we provide the Fortran code,
so you can change the software to achieve your aims.   
</p>
<p>
The software is not yet user friendly, and watch it like a hawk if you
move away from the (well trodden) path of particular parameters and
isochrones Rob and I have used.
On the other hand, I'm happy to help, and welcome suggestions
(especially in the form of revised code).
Watch out for pitfalls on the hints and tips pages, and if you start
using the software, drop me your e-mail address and I'll undertake to keep you
informed of developments.
</p>
<p>
So, you should first go to the downloads section, install the
software, and then try the examples.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to fitting your own data, I strongly advise that you first use the
program iso to create some simple isochrones that you can plot over your
data, to get some idea of where the parameters lie.
It will also allow you to find any outlying data points which should be removed
before you attempt a tau-squared fit.
