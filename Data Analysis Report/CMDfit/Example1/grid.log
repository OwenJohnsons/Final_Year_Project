 Read           16  of V vs B-V
 Will add V to B-V to create B
 > Give the extra uncertainty to be added to each magnitude.
 > Give the extra uncertainty to be added to each colour.
 > Give range of log10(ages) to be searched.
 > Give the range in distance modulus to be searched.
 > And the number of distance modulus points in the grid.
 > Give the required reddening in B-V
 > Give the fraction of stars which are likely to be members.
