abstract = {Terrestrial radio leakage as reflected off the moon has been observed with the Arecibo antenna. The authors find that military radars and television transmitters are main contributors in the 150 - 500 MHz range, as predicted in the model of Sullivan et al. (1978). The earth indeed is revealing itself (eventually) to any interstellar eavesdropper with an Arecibo-like antenna at distances up to 30 light years, and with a Cyclops-like system up to fifteen times farther.},
