<h1>CMDfit Bolometric Corrections</h1> 

<p>
Most of the bolometric corrections provided we have calculated ourselves by folding spectra through the appropriate filter responses.
In addition, by reddening the spectra before folding them through the resposes, we produce extinction tables.
The atmospheres we have used are the BT-Settl (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ASPC..448...91A">Allard et al, 2011</a>) and the Kurucz
(<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004astro.ph..5087C">Castelli & Kurucz, 2004</a>) new opacity, microturbulance 2km/s models.

The optical filter resposes we have are Bessell, INT-WFC, IPHAS/UVEX and SDSS.
In many cases we provide both photon counting and energy integrating versions, the former being suitable for CCD detectors, the latter for photomultiplier tubes.
In the IR we have the 2MASS and UKIDSS filters.
The extinctions are calculated using the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999PASP..111...63F">Fitzpatrick (1999)</a> curve, since <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.430.2188Y">Yuan el al (2013)</a> show this reproduces the observed extinctions in the optical and near IR well.
The references for the system responses are as follows.

UKIDSS.  The YZJHK system described in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.367..454H">Hewett et al (2006)</a>.  The zero point is assuming Vega has a magnitide of zero, except in the H-band where it is 0.03 mags (see <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.394..675H">Hodgkin et al 2009</a>).

In addition we provide the following sets of published tables of bolometric corrections.
</p>
<p>
The Bell et al (in prep) tuning to the Pleiades or Praesepe is noted in the options as "BT-Settl/Bell".
It is only available for certain interior models.
The tuning (which is for temperatures cooler than about 4000K) is based on the BT-Settl model atmospheres.
Above about 4000K the tables are either the BT-Settl BCs (for temperatures less than 8000K), or the Kurucz BCs (temperatures greater than
8000K).

<p>
Jeffries/Naylor.  These are available on request (since we believe they are superceded by Bell et al).
The bolometric corrections are derived from fitting observations for cool low-mass stars, and from 
<A HREF="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998A%26A...333..231B">
Bessell, Castelli & Plez (1998)</A> for the the hooter stars.
The technique is outlined in 
<A HREF="http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002MNRAS.335..291N&db_key=AST">Naylor et al (2002)</A>.
In one case the bolometric correction is from 
<A HREF="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...469..355F">
Flower (1996)</A>.
The conversions from effective temperature are derived from fitting the 
Pleiades ("Pleiades tuning") and is described in 
<A
