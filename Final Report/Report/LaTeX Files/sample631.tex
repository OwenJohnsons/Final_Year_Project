\begin{abstract}

% This example manuscript is intended to serve as a tutorial and template for
% authors to use when writing their own AAS Journal articles. The manuscript
% includes a history of \aastex\ and documents the new features in the
% previous versions as well as the bug fixes in version 6.31. This
% manuscript includes many figure and table examples to illustrate these new
% features.  Information on features not explicitly mentioned in the article
% can be viewed in the manuscript comments or more extensive online
% documentation. Authors are welcome replace the text, tables, figures, and
% bibliography with their own and submit the resulting manuscript to the AAS
% Journals peer review system.  The first lesson in the tutorial is to remind
% authors that the AAS Journals, the Astrophysical Journal (ApJ), the
% Astrophysical Journal Letters (ApJL), the Astronomical Journal (AJ), and
% the Planetary Science Journal (PSJ) all have a 250 word limit for the 
% abstract\footnote{Abstracts for Research Notes of the American Astronomical 
% Society (RNAAS) are limited to 150 words}.  If you exceed this length the
% Editorial office will ask you to shorten it. This abstract has 182 words.
